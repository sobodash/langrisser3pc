Everyone, listen up!<$FFFE>
I will try to hold them back here!<$FFFC>
You others go on ahead!<$FFFE>
Y..Yes.<$FFFE>
Ummm, Pierre...<$FFFE>
Ha, what is it?<$FFFC>
Miss Riffany?<$FFFE>
I might be able to help too.<$FFFC>
After all I can use magic to some extent.<$FFFE>
...!<$FFFE>
Hahaha, you honestly believed you could escape from me?<$FFFC>
But you see, there's nothing we enjoy more than a good manhunt!<$FFFE>
Yeah!<$FFFE>
Please, Miss Riffany!<$FFFC>
If it is getting too dangerous, you have to make a run for it.<$FFFE>
Okay.<$FFFE>
Baron Torrand's mansion lies just beyond these mountains.<$FFFE>
So, we should be there soon enough.<$FFFE>
Oh!<$FFFC>
[diehardt's name], look over there!<$FFFE>
Some Larcussian refugees are being persecuted by the imperial troops!<$FFFE>
We cannot simply abandon them.<$FFFC>
Let's rush to their aid!<$FFFE>
Understood.<$FFFE>
Pierre.<$FFFC>
There seem to be friendly soldiers coming from this direction.<$FFFE>
What stroke of luck!<$FFFC>
I bet they'll come to our help.<$FFFD>
Heey!<$FFFC>
We are being chased by those nasty Imperials!<$FFFC>
Would you mind lending us a hand here!?<$FFFE>
Hold out!<$FFFC>
We will be there right away.<$FFFE>
Thanks.<$FFFC>
In that case, what do you want us to do?<$FFFE>
Understood.<$FFFC>
We'll see to it!<$FFFE>
Oh my.<$FFFC>
Now there are enemy soldiers in both directions.<$FFFE>
We are not your enemy.<$FFFC>
We are here to help you!<$FFFE>
Oh, I'm sorry to have mistaken you.<$FFFC>
In that case, what would be the best thing for me to do?<$FFFE>
Understood.<$FFFE>
Miss Riffany!<$FFFC>
Try to hold back the enemy!<$FFFE>
Understood.<$FFFE>
Oh well, The Larcuss survivors doesn't seem to be such pushovers after all.<$FFFC>
But they are not the type of enemy that can bother me!<$FFFE>
Umm,<$FFFC>
the battle has moved on quiet a bit, do have new orders?<$FFFE>
OK!<$FFFC>
Will do.<$FFFE>
Well,<$FFFC>
is there anything I can help you with?<$FFFE>
Yes.<$FFFC>
I'll do just that.<$FFFE>
Reporting in!<$FFFC>
Remnants of the Larcussian army have appeared.<$FFFC>
They seem to be set for battle!<$FFFE>
So there are Larcuss survivors even in such a place?<$FFFE>
What could they possibly be up to?<$FFFE>
I'm sure they are headed towards the landlord of this domain, Baron Torrand...<$FFFD>
He is said to be quiet the strategist.<$FFFC>
They probably plan to make use of his skills, that's bad news.<$FFFC>
Convey this new development to headquarters right away!<$FFFE>
Yessir!<$FFFE>
Well then, ladies and gentlemen.<$FFFC>
It's time for the hunt to begin.<$FFFD>
Flying units encircle them and cut off their path of retreat!<$FFFE>
Leave it to us!<$FFFE>
General Geier!<$FFFC>
We have arrived at the designated location!<$FFFE>
Good.<$FFFC>
Cut off their route to escape as planned!<$FFFC>
Encircle them and don't leave a single one of them alive!<$FFFE>
Yessir!<$FFFE>
How disgusting, targeting unarmed citizens like that!<$FFFE>
Hehehe...<$FFFC>
You are just a whelp on the field of battle, war always is a disgusting thing.<$FFFD>
In the end the strong hunt down the weak, it's the most natural thing of all.<$FFFE>
Say, [diehardt's name].<$FFFC>
Do you have orders in mind for the citizens too?<$FFFE>
Let me think....<$FFFE>
Do you want to give out orders?<$FFFE>
Which direction should the citizens escape to?<$FFFE>
Escape to the east<$FFFE>
Escape to the west<$FFFE>
Listen up everyone, all citizens should escape to the east!<$FFFE>
Y..Yes!<$FFFE>
Listen up everyone, all citizens should escape to the west!<$FFFE>
Eehh!?<$FFFE>
Do you even listen to what you're saying!?<$FFFC>
That way they'll be caught by the imperial soldiers right away!<$FFFE>
O..Oh...<$FFFC>
That's right.<$FFFD>
My bad, everyone.<$FFFC>
Please escape this way!<$FFFE>
Yes!<$FFFE>
No.<$FFFC>
Most likely they will make their escape this way just fine.<$FFFE>
Sir, I'm heading back to headquarters to deliver the message!<$FFFE>
Good.<$FFFE>
Lord Altemüller has to be informed about their activities.<$FFFE>
Are you unhurt?<$FFFE>
Yes.<$FFFC>
I'm fine, but what about the citizens...?<$FFFE>
Thanks to your help they are all safe.<$FFFE>
Now, that's a relief.<$FFFE>
...I understand your concern.<$FFFC>
You can leave the rest to us.<$FFFE>
Alright, I've got only so much of my power left...<$FFFE>
Are you alright?<$FFFE>
Yeah, all thanks to you.<$FFFD>
By the way, why did you tell the citizens to go west just about now?<$FFFE>
What do you reply?<$FFFE>
It was a joke<$FFFE>
I've got no sense of direction<$FFFE>
I wanted to test my companion's sense of direction<$FFFE>
It was just a joke.<$FFFE>
I see.<$FFFC>
You really got me with this one.<$FFFE>
Hahaha...<$FFFC>
I'm sorry about that.<$FFFE>
It's quiet shameful.<$FFFC>
To tell the truth, I've got no sense of direction.<$FFFE>
So that's how it is!<$FFFC>
You really startled me there for one moment.<$FFFD>
From now on you should leave the pathfinding to someone more able ion that department, [diehardt's name].<$FFFE>
Yeah.<$FFFC>
I'll be more careful next time.<$FFFE>
[diehardt's name], you're such a wuss!<$FFFE>
My?<$FFFC>
I think having such a side to oneself is quiet adorable, really.<$FFFE>
I simply was testing my comrade's sense of direction.<$FFFC>
After all, the leader needs to know the extent of his companion's abilities!<$FFFE>
Hah...<$FFFC>
I wonder if that's the way it is...<$FFFE>
If you have something to say, say it straight to my face!<$FFFE>
Sure, sure.<$FFFC>
No reason to get all angry like that.<$FFFE>
Thank you for saving me.<$FFFE>
Save me...<$FFFE>
Help...<$FFFE>
That's just how far your pathetic little uprising goes.<$FFFD>
Too bad this excellent amusement will come to an end soon.<$FFFC>
Now it's time to get a bit more serious.<$FFFE>
Geier!<$FFFC>
The way you play with the life of others is inexcusable!<$FFFD>
Prepare yourself!<$FFFE>
Such empty threats!<$FFFC>
You miserable lot can come at me all at once, then I'll show to you the extent of your helplessness!<$FFFE>
Before you there is a hole in which a spirit of the land resides.<$FFFE>
What do you do?<$FFFE>
Cover it with earth<$FFFE>
Leave it alone<$FFFE>
Stamp on it with your feet<$FFFE>
When you cover the hole hole with earth the spirit of the land appears.<$FFFD>
"What do you think you're doing!?<$FFFC>
Take this and leave me alone!"<$FFFE>
Obtained 500P.<$FFFE>
Nothing happened.<$FFFE>
Shortly after you start stomping on the ground, the spirit of the land shows up.<$FFFD>
What is all this noise about!?<$FFFC>
Why has Washi's nap been disturbed?<$FFFD>
Hmm?<$fe><$3c><$FFFC>
Now, would you be so kind to leave me alone?<$FFFC>
Do you want to say something?<$FFFE>
What do you want to say?<$FFFE>
Understood.<$FFFC>
Yeah, yeah take this and leave me be alright.<$FFFE>
Magic Herb was obtained!<$FFFE>
...Please excuse my rudeness.<$FFFC>
To reward your honest heart,<$FFFC>
take this and let Washi have a nap now...<$FFFE>
Egil Helm was obtained!<$FFFE>
Dammit!<$FFFE>
Uuu..<$FFFC>
It's useless...<$FFFE>
Forgive me...<$FFFC>
Oh..I can't fight anymore...<$FFFE>
I'm sorry...<$FFFC>
And this was only the beginning...<$FFFE>
Uwaa!<$FFFE>
Everyone, we will protect you!<$FFFC>
We won't let them get past here no matter what!<$FFFE>
Oh?<$FFFC>
There's no strength left in this body...<$FFFE>
Here I go!<$FFFE>
Miss Riffany, are you alright!?<$FFFE>
There's no need to be concerned.<$FFFC>
I can still fight.<$FFFE>
If it helps you to escape,<$FFFC>
I can die without regrets...<$FFFE>
Kyaaa!!<$FFFE>
Oh no...<$FFFC>
Only if I had a little bit more power...<$FFFE>
This can't be happening...<$FFFE>
Prepare yourself!<$FFFE>
Have at you!<$FFFE>
You stand no chance against the imperial forces!<$FFFE>
This...<$FFFE>
I..Impossible how could some rag-tag soldiers best me?<$FFFD>
It must have been because we only had light equipment for the hunt with us.<$FFFD>
I'll retreat for now.<$FFFC>
I leave the rest to you!<$FFFE>
Y..You can't just!<$FFFC>
General!?<$FFFE>
Well then, let us enjoy ourselves a little bit!<$FFFE>
Oh...<$FFFC>
Some prey of social standing has come into sight, pointing a sword at me!<$FFFE>
Guaaar!<$FFFE>
Urrg...!<$FFFE>
Wh..why!?<$FFFE>
How...dare you...!<$FFFE>
Sir Geiurrg!<$FFFE>
Here of all places...<$FFFE>
Guwaa!<$FFFE>
Uaargg!<$FFFE>
Another one tries to escape!<$FFFC>
Die quietly!<$FFFE>
Whaat!?<$FFFE>
Kyaaa!<$FFFC>
Someone help me!<$FFFE>
Your wasting your breath!<$FFFC>
No one can help you now!<$FFFE>
Th..that's just a scratch...<$FFFD>
Guaaarr!<$FFFE>
Hmph, they don't play half bad...<$FFFE>
Tssk!<$FFFC>
Such feckless maggots calling themselves soldiers.<$FFFD>
What you saw today was nothing but a spearhead of our troops.<$FFFC>
It's hopeless.<$FFFC>
For the moment I will pull back , but don't think you accomplished anything. The real war has just begun.<$FFFE>
Phew, it's finally over.<$FFFE>
You can say that again.<$FFFC>
But [diehardt's name], what on earth were you thinking when telling them to go west!?<$FFFD>
And don't give me that poor excuse that worked for Pierre...<$FFFE>
What is your reaction?<$FFFE>
Get upset<$FFFE>
Apologize like a good boy<$FFFE>
Pout<$FFFE>
That was no excuse!<$FFFC>
It was nothing but the truth!<$FFFE>
*Sigh*...<$FFFC>
Always the tough cookie...<$FFFE>
I'm sorry.<$FFFC>
You looked right through me.<$FFFE>
Hah...<$FFFC>
Your growing soft these days, [diehardt's name].<$FFFE>
...<$FFFE>
[diehardt's name] I can't believe it, now you're pouting?<$FFFC>
Honestly, that's so childish!<$FFFE>
<$F702><$F703><$F702><$F703><$F704><$F704>My name is [diehardt's name].<$FFFC>
As of now, we're on a mission to help rebuilding the Kingdom.<$FFFE>
<$F705><$F705><$F706><$F706><$F707><$F707>Pierre and Riffany have joined the party!<$FFFE>
.....<$FFFE>
What do you want to say?<$FFFE>
Welcome them<$FFFE>
Feeling uneasy about sending woman to battle<$FFFE>
Say nothing<$FFFE>
Welcome aboard, you two.<$FFFE>
It pains me having to send women into battle, but your help could proof indispensable, therefore I accept your offer gratefully.<$FFFD>
Nonetheless, please take special care not to get hurt, miss Riffany.<$FFFE>
Thank you, I appreciate your concern.<$FFFE>
Thank you, I appreciate your concern.<$FFFE>
Is everyone alright?<$FFFE>
Is everyone alright?<$FFFE>
Thanks to your intervention,<$FFFC>
everybody seems to be fine.<$FFFE>
Thanks to your intervention,<$FFFC>
everybody seems to be fine.<$FFFE>
We are here on behalf of Viscount Raymond.<$FFFC>
May I ask for an audience with Baron Torrand.<$FFFE>
Of course.<$FFFC>
Let me show you the way then.<$FFFE>
Of course.<$FFFC>
Let me show you the way then.<$FFFE>
No wait!<$FFFC>
I will take the lead!<$FFFE>
Let me think...<$FFFE>
What are your orders?<$FFFE>
Hold your position<$FFFE>
Attack the enemy<$FFFE>
Escape this way<$FFFE>
For the moment just stand by and wait for orders.<$FFFC>
Help is on the way!<$FFFE>
Go ahead and attack the enemy!<$FFFC>
We'll be right there to back you up!<$FFFE>
For now, make your escape this way!<$FFFE>
Do you want to change instructions for Pierre and Riffany?<$FFFE>
Do you want to change instructions for Pierre?<$FFFE>
Do you want to change instructions for Riffany?<$FFFE>
What are your orders?<$FFFE>
Hold your position<$FFFE>
Attack the enemy<$FFFE>
Escape to the east<$FFFE>
Hold your ground.<$FFFE>
Assault the enemy.<$FFFE>
Escape to the east!<$FFFE>
The citizens that escaped just gave me this strange item as a token of their gratitude to you.<$FFFD>
Here take it,[diehardt's name].<$FFFE>
Divine Blessing was obtained!<$FFFE>
Thanks, Pierre.<$FFFE>
Huh!?<$FFFC>
The imperial army is here!?<$FFFE>
What?<$FFFC>
Are those enemy reinforcements!?<$FFFE>
I'm Luna, daughter to Lord Torrand, ruler of this land!<$FFFC>
Your trespassing will not be tolerated!<$FFFE>
That's Baron Torrand's daughter over there!<$FFFE>
I see.<$FFFC>
Her timing is pretty good.<$FFFE>
Torrand's daughter...<$FFFC>
She just showed up in due time...<$FFFE>
Thanks, you really saved our necks!<$FFFC>
I'm, Pierre.<$FFFC>
Knights apprentice hailing from the Royal Capitol Larcuss.<$FFFE>
However Larcussia is currently occupied by the Empire, that's why we all are on the run.<$FFFE>
You can call me Riffany.<$FFFC>
I'm currently studying magic under my parents guidance.<$FFFE>
My father, Viscount Raymond is currently amassing troops to defend against the attacks of the Colcian Kingdom.<$FFFD>
We're currently on our way to enlist the help of Baron Torrand, the genius strategist.<$FFFE>
That means you all are trying to restore the Kingdom...<$FFFC>
Alright! I'm coming with you!<$FFFE>
If I may, I also would like to join to express my gratitude.<$FFFC>
I'm also concerned about my parents well-being in Larcussia and that way I think I can help them too.<$FFFE>

15th day, 5th moon<$FFFC>
今日もいい天気。<$FFFD>
お日様もぽかぽかして、とってもいい気持ち。<$FFFD>
隣では、お兄ちゃんが、敵がいないかどうか一生懸命警戒してる。<$FFFD>
あーあ、これが平和な時で、お兄ちゃんとピクニックっていうのだったらどんなに楽しいのに。<$FFFD>
そしたらティア、お兄ちゃんのために、腕によりをかけて、おいしいお弁当作ってあげるんだ。<$FFFD>
こう見えたって、ティアは、お料理得意なんだから。<$FFFE>
そりゃあ、レイラさんみたいに上手じゃないし、<$FFFD>
たまに（本当にたまになんだからね）、お塩とお砂糖を間違えることもあるけど。<$FFFD>
あーあ、早く平和にならないかな。<$FFFD>
すっかり、現実逃避にはしっちゃったけど、今日新しい仲間ができたの。<$FFFD>
ピエールさんと、リファニーさん。<$FFFD>
ピエールさんは、騎士見習いで、カッコイイというより、カワイイってカンジ。<$FFFD>
リファニーさんは、おっとりしていて面白い人だけど、キレイな人だからちょっと心配。<$FFFD>
だって、お兄ちゃんたっら、あいさつしてる時、鼻の下ながーくしてるんだもん。<$FFFD>
ティア、お兄ちゃんの脚ぎゅうってツネっちゃった。<$FFFD>
お料理も得意だって言うし、ちょっと強敵ってカンジ。でも、ティア、負けないもん！<$FFFE>
-Riffany's diary-<$FFFD>
15th day, 5th moon, Sunny<$FFFC>
雲１つないいい天気。<$FFFD>
本当でしたら、こんな日はうれしいものですのに、<$FFFD>
今日ほど、雨でも降ればいいのにと思ったことはありませんわ。<$FFFD>
きっと、雨がわたくし達と帝国兵たちの目から隠してくれるでしょうから。<$FFFD>
ラーカシアから脱出して２日あまり。<$FFFD>
みなさん、そろそろ限界にきているようで脱出したのを後悔なさっている方も多いみたい。<$FFFD>
みんなをまとめているピエールさんも大変そう。<$FFFD>
そして、とうとう、帝国の追手に追い付かれてしまいました。<$FFFD>
そんな時、私達を助けてくださったのは、[diehardt's name]さんの率いる解放軍の方々でした。<$FFFD>
[diehardt's name]さんは、叙任をすませたばかりの騎士様で、頼もしいお方。<$FFFD>
まるで白馬の王子様みたいに、わたくし達を助けてくださいました。<$FFFD>
ティアリスちゃんっていう元気でかわいい女の子。<$FFFD>
[diehardt's name]さんのことをお兄ちゃんと呼んでいましたけど、兄妹なのかしら？<$FFFD>
とくに行くあてもないので[diehardt's name]さんと一緒に行くことにしましたけど、これからどうなるのかしら？<$FFFD>
とりあえず、今日は、ベッドで休めるのがなにより幸せですわ。<$FFFE>
-Luna's diary-<$FFFD>
15th day, 5th moon, Sunny<$FFFD>
本日、正午をすぎたころ、ラーカシアへ向かう山道で、帝国軍に追われる、市民を発見する。<$FFFD>
ちょうど、こちらに向かっていたレイモンド子爵の使いの方が帝国軍と交戦していたため、これを援護、帝国軍を撃退する。<$FFFD>
避難民と使いの方を案内して、屋敷に戻る。<$FFFD>
浮遊城が陥落してからというもの、帝国軍の勢いは増すばかりだ。<$FFFD>
各地で孤立している同胞と連絡をとり、協力して敵にあたりたいところだが、うまくいかない。<$FFFD>
さすが帝国元帥が出てくるだけのことはある。<$FFFE>
