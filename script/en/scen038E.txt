Gyudon's Restaurant<$FFFF>
Welcome!<$FFFE>
Phew...<$FFFC>
I'm pretty worn-out.<$FFFE>
It seems to be your turn to treat, your Excellency.<$FFFE>
Just as I planned.<$FFFD>
We'll take three extra large portions of the usual.<$FFFE>
Roger, three extra large portions coming up!<$FFFE>
When Geier and Emaillink find out about this, they'll regret not tagging along. <$FFFE>
Well, it couldn't be helped.<$FFFD>
Geier is still chasing those refugees and Emaillink headed out to lead the assault on Baron Torrand.<$FFFE>
Anyway, it's been way to long since we came here.<$FFFC>
Let's enjoy this!<$FFFE>
Say, [diehardt's name]!<$FFFC>
It couldn't be that we've lost the way thanks to you making a fuss about leading the way yourself, right!?<$FFFE>
W..What are you saying!?<$FFFC>
You're just imagining things.<$FFFE>
Sir, [diehardt's name].<$FFFC>
I know I said it before, but the mansion is actually located in this direction...<$FFFE>
Not you too, Luna.<$FFFC>
Really, you can trust me on this.<$FFFE>
...My?<$FFFC>
Is it just me or is there a nice scent in the air around here?<$FFFE>
...*Sniff-sniff*<$fe><$28>.<$FFFC>
You're right!<$FFFE>
...what's a place like this doing in the middle of the forest!?<$FFFE>
Welcome, Welcome.<$FFFD>
Enjoy the homy atmosphere and only the finest of the eastern cuisine.<$FFFD>
Just come right in, I'm sure you'll love it if you give it a try.<$FFFE>
Sounds worthwhile.<$FFFC>
Tell me, what would be the name that establishment of yours goes by?<$FFFE>
It's called "Hidden Gyudon Restaurant".<$FFFE>
Let's eat, EAT!<$FFFD>
Hey, [diehardt's name].<$FFFC>
You don't mind, right?<$FFFE>
Fine.<$FFFC>
I guess we've got some time to spare.<$FFFE>
Yay!<$FFFE>
Unfortunately this forest is also being haunted by evil spirits and there probably will be monsters lurking around, so please be careful.<$FFFE> 
No biggie, we're used to this kind of stuff.<$FFFE>
Alright everyone, let's go!<$FFFE>
そうだ、お客さん。<$FFFD>
ここのネタがわからない時は、ラング１のミニドラマ入りＣＤを買うと、もっと楽しくなるそうですよ。<$FFFE>
？<$FFFC>
それはどう言う意味だ？<$FFFE>
センデンって言うのじゃ無いの、それ？<$FFFE>
どうしてそんなディープなネタをやるのかしら。<$FFFE>
わからなくても、一応は楽しめるようになっていると思われますが‥‥。<$FFFE>
そうだな。<$FFFC>
そう信じて進んでみよう！<$FFFE>
Sir [diehardt's name]!<$FFFD>
Th..The enemy had extra large portions!<$FFFE>
Wh..What!?<$FFFC>
Extra large portions, this is bad...<$FFFE>
[diehardt's name]!<$FFFC>
They make us look like dejected losers!<$FFFE>
Damn...<$FFFE>
I have to come up with something fast.<$FFFC>
Alright, there's only one way to turn the tables now...<$FFFD>
Excuse me, I'd like to order an egg!<$FFFE>
Egg!<$FFFE>
Egg!<$FFFE>
Egg!<$FFFE>
Egg!<$FFFE>
Egg!<$FFFE>
Egg!<$FFFE>
Second gear, seven eggs, here you go.<$FFFE>
That's it for today, we're closing.<$FFFE>
Damn!<$FFFC>S
We have failed to get ourselves some Gyudon...<$FFFE>
You're nothing but a COLOSSAL FAILURE! F.A.I.L.U.R.E!!<$FFFE>
Gyudon, Gyudon!<$FFFC>
Ready up some tasty food for me, Lalalala!<$FFFE>
They said eastern cuisine; I wonder if they refer to the cooking methods of the Yamato Kingdom.<$FFFE>
What's the Yamato Kingdom?<$FFFE>
It's a kingdom very far to the east. A swordsman who currently serves father hails from those lands.<$FFFE>
Soo, that Gyudon stuff comes from that far away place too? Will our tummies be ok?<$FFFE>
Since he's owning a restaurant in these parts, I'm confident they will, but we'll just have to try it to be sure.<$FFFE>
Guess so.<$FFFE>
Please prepare one more portion for General Geier.<$FFFE>
I'd be glad to.<$FFFE>
You are too kind, your Excellency.<$FFFE>
Hey.<$FFFE>
Yes, is there anything else I can help you with?<$FFFE>
We would like to order another four portions of Asazuke and Miso Soup.<$FFFE>
Certainly, four portions of mixed pickles and Miso Soup, coming right up!<$FFFE>
We would like to order another three portions of Asazuke and Miso Soup.<$FFFE>
Certainly, three portions of mixed pickles and Miso Soup, coming right up!<$FFFE>
*Gasp*!<$FFFC>
The enemy has ordered additional portions of mixed pickles and Miso Soup!<$FFFE>
Wh..What!?<$FFFE>
Mixed Pickles AND Miso Soup!?<$FFFC>
...The enemy must be preparing for the final stroke.<$FFFE>
It all depends on me now. But just what should I order next?<$FFFD>
It has to be something outshining everything that has been there before!<$FFFE>
[diehardt's name]!<$FFFE>
Sir [diehardt's name]!<$FFFE>
You have to make a decision!<$FFFE>
What will you have?<$FFFE>
Beefsteak<$FFFE>
Beefsteak<$FFFE>
Beefsteak<$FFFE>
Thank you for choosing us.<$FFFC>
The restaurant is this way.<$FFFE>
Thanks.<$FFFD>
By the way, what's Gyudon?<$FFFE>
Basically it's steamed rice with variable fixings.<$FFFE>
What do you say?<$FFFE>
How can you serve something like that<$FFFE>
Sounds delicious<$FFFE>
Outrageous, how can you even serve something like that!?<$FFFE>
T..That's...<$FFFE>
Ill-mannered savage!<$FFFE>
Hmm.<$FFFC>
It certainly sounds like something I'd like to try.<$FFFE>
Oh, before I forget!<$FFFC>
We will close soon so you'll have to hurry a bit.<$FFFE>
Well, that's good to know!<$FFFC>
Let's hurry, everyone!<$FFFE>
Say, Tiaris.<$FFFC>
Wouldn't you agree that [diehardt's name] is acting a bit weird today?<$FFFE>
Nope.<$FFFC>
That's just the way he really is.<$FFFE>
.<$fe><$32>.<$fe><$32>.<$fe><$32>.<$fe><$32>.<$fe><$32>.<$FFFC>
I...I see.<$FFFE>
Welcome!<$FFFC>
Please take seats to the right side.<$FFFE>
We're saved.<$FFFC>
I felt like keeling over from hunger any minute now.<$FFFE>
Let's dig in!<$FFFE>
Sir [diehardt's name], do you see the same thing, or are my eyes playing tricks on me?<$FFFE>
If you by chance are referring to the bulk of the Imperial Commanders, I'm afraid that I see them too.<$FFFE>
Dear Costumers.<$FFFC>
I would greatly appreciate it if you could take seats and make your order in the not so distant future.<$FFFD>
You see, it's almost home time...<$FFFE>
Oh, of course.<$FFFC>
Everyone, hurry up and get inside!<$FFFE>
Everyone's inside now.<$FFFC>
All that's left to do now is to get to our seats to the right and make our order!<$FFFE>
What can I do for you?<$FFFE>
How much is that Gyoden dish, we've heard so much about?<$FFFE>
250P each.<$FFFE>
Who is going to get something to eat?<$FFFE>
Only yourself<$FFFE>
Just the girls<$FFFE>
The whole crew<$FFFE>
In that case, I'll take one dish.<$FFFE>
There you go, one portion of Gyudon.<$FFFE>
You're the biggest jerk ever!<$FFFE>
This is the epitome of cruelty.<$FFFE>
In that case bring us dishes equalling the number of girls in our group.<$FFFE>
I appreciate the gesture but...<$FFFC>
It just wouldn't feel right to eat while everyone else comes away empty-handed.<$FFFE>
My thoughts exactly.<$FFFE>
Same here....and don't think we didn't notice the measly attempt to kiss up to all the females at once.<$FFFE>
Busted...<$FFFC>
My ulterior motives have been revealed...<$FFFE>
In that case, please serve dishes for everyone.<$FFFE>
Thank you kindly.<$FFFC>
That'll be 1750P.<$FFFE>
There you go, 7 dishes of Gyudon.<$FFFE>
This is awesome!<$FFFE>
Pierre's strength rises +1<$FFFE>
Delicious, indeed.<$FFFE>
Lewin's strength rises +1<$FFFE>
Oho...<$FFFC>
So, this is the what the famed eastern cuisine tastes like.<$FFFE>
Gilbert's strength rises +1<$FFFE>
Hmm...<$FFFC>
This is yummy.<$FFFE>
Such a peculiar flavor.<$FFFC>
This was alone was well-worth the detour.<$FFFE>
Thank you for the treat.<$FFFE>
Shouldn't we order something to eat by now?<$FFFE>
How impolite!<$FFFC>
But it certainly suits you.<$FFFE>
Well at least I'm not running around looking silly, while stuffing my face!<$FFFC>
Calm down, one shouldn't eat while being upset.<$FFFE>
If I'm such an eyesore, I'll leave!<$FFFE>
Here it is.<$FFFC>
The rumored restaurant...<$FFFE>
Welcome!<$FFFE>
Hm?<$FFFC>
Well, if it isn't General Geier!<$FFFD>
Got any results on the war-front?<$FFFE>
This certainly is no place for such matters.<$FFFD>
Come in and have a seat.<$FFFE>
Yessir...<$FFFE>
Having some well-made Gyudon after a hard battle, surely lifts the spirits.<$FFFE>
Hmph.<$FFFE>
You notice a small hole inside the pillar of stone.<$FFFE>
What do you do?<$FFFE>
Shoot at it<$FFFE>
Put your hand in it<$FFFE>
Just watch it<$FFFE>
The hole gets buried underneath loosening rocks.<$FFFE>
When you put your hand into it, something with nasty little teeth bites it.<$FFFD>
You pull out your hand, but the hole is being buried by loosening rocks.<$FFFE>
After a while of staring at the hole, a voice can be heard from within :<$FFFD>
"You shall be rewarded for paying your respect to my residence!"<$FFFE>
<$f6>Guidance<$fc>The strength of your troops attack improved!<$FFFE>
I'm such an idiot...<$FFFE>
Gyudon....<$FFFE>
Impossible!<$FFFE>
Dang!<$FFFC>
You're too careless...<$FFFE>
Aah...<$FFFE>
I wanted to eat Gyudon with everyone...<$FFFE>
How did it come to this...<$FFFE>
I...finally...<$FFFC>
found a work...that suited me...<$FFFE>
Bunny Suit was obtained!<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
Do you want to put it on right away?<$FFFE>
I always dreamed <$FFFD>
I just can't resist it...<$FFFC>
I have to slip into this right away....<$FFFD>
Not bad, a pretty tight fit...<$FFFE>
Groooss!<$FFFC>
Have you gone completely out of your mind!<$FFFE>
Oh far from it, I just changed equipment somewhat...<$FFFE>
Despicable...<$FFFE>
I absolutely refuse having a sicko like yourself anywhere near me or my father's mansion!<$FFFE>
Uurggh!<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
Such massive rejection...can't bear the pain...<$FFFE>
[diehardt's name]'s body mineralized, turning him into a grotesque statue of stone...<$FFFE>
Kyaaahh!<$FFFC>
Do you even understand what you've done?<$FFFE>
I lost control for a moment...no, someone took control...<$FFFE>
Such cruelty...<$FFFC>
To think you'd be able to do something so heartless...<$FFFE>
I absolutely refuse having a murderer like yourself anywhere near me or my father's mansion!<$FFFE>
What...have I...<$FFFE>
This is beyond words!<$FFFC>
Killing a fellow human purely on a whim!<$FFFE>
So this is what the remnants of Larcuss have come to.<$FFFD>
I must have overestimated them greatly...<$FFFE>
PUSYU!<$FFFE>
PUSYU!<$FFFE>
PUSYU!<$FFFE>
PUSYU!<$FFFE>
PUSYU!<$FFFE>
PUSYU!<$FFFE>
PUSYU!<$FFFE>
PUSYU!<$FFFE>
Exterminating all those monsters took us quiet an amount of time.<$FFFE>
I shall lead us to my father's mansion without any further delay.<$FFFE>
Now way...<$FFFC>
Tsk!<$FFFC>
What a letdown.<$FFFE>
Sir, [diehardt's name].<$FFFC>
I will take the lead from here on out.<$FFFC>
You don't have any objections, I presume?<$FFFE>
What do you reply?<$FFFE>
Not a chance<$FFFE>
Understood<$FFFE>
Not a chance!<$FFFE>
This farce ends right here.<$FFFC>
This is hardly the time for prideful ado. If you insist on acting like a stubborn child, we'll simply leave you behind.<$FFFE>
I get it alright.<$FFFC>
Please show us the way to Lord Torrand's mansion.<$FFFE>
Understood.<$FFFC>
I'll leave it to you.<$FFFE>
I'm glad you see reason.<$FFFC>
Everyone, please follow me!<$FFFE>
Seven Beefsteaks please!<$FFFE>
Sorry, that's not on the menu...<$FFFE>
Hmph, the dire overeagerness of youth claims another victim.<$FFFE>
It's no use.<$FFFC>
We don't have enough money!<$FFFE>
[diehardt's name], you idiot!<$FFFE>
Thanks, this looks really tasty!<$FFFE>
[diehardt's name]'s strength rises +1<$FFFE>
