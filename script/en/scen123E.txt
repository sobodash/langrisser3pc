Rigüler Imperial castle ~ Audience Hall<$FFFF>
Field Marshal Altemüller...<$FFFC>
The invasion of Larcussia was a splendid success, thanks to your efforts.<$FFFD>
If we were to conquer the Vice Capitol Laffel next, it surely would benefit the whole Empire...<$FFFE>
Understood!<$FFFC>
It shall be as you wish.<$FFFE>
 <$FFFC>
The future of the Empire depends....<$FFFC>
...Aghh!<$FFFE>
Father...<$FFFE>
Don't worry yourself...<$FFFC>
As of late, I don't feel...<$FFFD>
 <$FFFC>
....Ugh!<$FFFE>
Your Majesty!?<$FFFE>
Vice Capitol Laffel<$FFFF>
Sir, the princess has arrived.<$FFFE>
Good.<$FFFE>
Father,<$FFFC>
it has been a while.<$FFFE>
Oh, Flaire.<$FFFC>
How do you like Laffel?<$FFFC>
I guess if you compare it to the Royal Capitol Larcussia it isn't much though...<$FFFD>
But no matter,<$FFFC>
sooner or later we will conquer the royal capitol as well.<$FFFE>
It seems like Larcussia has fallen into the hands of the Rigüler Empire...<$FFFE>
Father, don't tell me you are planning to go against the Empire!?<$FFFE>
There's no need to be concerned.<$FFFC>
With General Dios and our newest associate even the Empire will bow down before us...<$FFFE>
....<$FFFE>
Who is he...?<$FFFE>
A man with a heart as black as the night...Dark Knight, would be a suitable name, no?<$FFFC>
He will act as Barral's new supreme commander.<$FFFD>
I can't wait to put him to test against the Empire...<$FFFC>
Hohohoho!<$FFFE>
 <$FFFE>
The Imperials already have made their move, now it's our turn to take our slice of the cake.<$FFFD>
Glory for the Kingdom of Colcia!<$FFFC>
All troops advance!<$FFFE>
 <$FFFC>
 <$FFFC>
Oohhh!<$FFFE>
