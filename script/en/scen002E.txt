The Floating Castle<$FFFF>
Honestly!<$FFFC>
Why does this has to happen at such a time....<$FFFE>
They probably used the stormy weather to their advantage<$FFFC>
and hid themselves in the clouds, while approaching the castle unnoticed.<$FFFE>
I guess they also chose this day because today was the investiture ceremony.<$FFFE>
Yeah.<$FFFC>
That was favourable for them too.<$FFFD>
But complaining about it won't help us right now.<$FFFC>
Let's go Tiaris.<$FFFC>
We have to protect the Magical Cannon!<$FFFE>
We are in time.<$FFFC>
The enemy has yet to appear.<$FFFE>
Let us hurry and prepare to intercept the enemy here.<$FFFE>
On your positions!<$FFFE>
Lord William!<$FFFC>
The enemy has come into sight!<$FFFE>
Get ready to intercept them!<$FFFE>
The enemy is awaiting us.<$FFFE>
It seems our strategy has failed your Excellency.<$FFFE>
Hmph.<$FFFC>
Hmmph. So they predicted our main force would come from the east side.<$FFFE>
This should be interesting.<$FFFC>
Alright!<$FFFC>
Destroy the central crystal whatever it takes!<$FFFE>
Seems like those imperials on the east side go after the crystal too.<$FFFE>
Yeah!<$FFFC>
If the crystal would be destroyed the Magical Cannon would lose its energy and the flying castle would fall right out of the sky!<$FFFE>
This could lead to the destruction of the whole Larcussian Kingdom.<$FFFC>
We must prevent that from happening at all cost!<$FFFE>
Papa.....<$FFFE>
Lord William was defeated<$FFFC>
That guy Altemüller sure is a dreadful enemy.<$FFFE>
Charge!<$FFFC>
Destroy the Demonic Cannon!<$FFFE>
On your positions!<$FFFE>
Yessir!<$FFFE>
Diehärte, I entrust my daughter's safety to you.<$FFFE>
Leave her to me!<$FFFE>
Hey, don't treat me like a child!<$FFFE>
Everyone move out!<$FFFC>
Protect the crystal to the bitter end!<$FFFE>
Understood!<$FFFE>
I will prove that the strength of the flying fortress not comes from the demonic gun alone!<$FFFE>
For the Duke's sake we cannot be defeated!<$FFFE>
Knight Geriord<$FFFC>
You'll have to face me now.<$FFFE>
....<$FFFE>
And now its only the crystal that needs to be destroyed...<$FFFE>
Stop!<$FFFE>
Khe!<$FFFC>
Have to protect the crystal.....<$FFFE>
This is just a scratch...<$FFFC>
Nevertheless we will be the driving force soon....<$FFFD>
...Geriord.<$FFFC>
It is the regrettable man.<$FFFE>
With this the fate of Larcuss is sealed.<$FFFE>
So this is how it ends.<$FFFE>
Even though the Rigüler field Marshal is still young,<$FFFC>
he claimed victory for himself...<$FFFE>
Diehärte....<$FFFE>
You have to make your way to the city of Laffel and contact our allies the Barral Kingdom <$FFFC>
Then army must be formed to initiate the counter attack.<$FFFE>
And please take care of my daughter and Geriord in my stead...<$FFFE>
Papa!<$FFFE>
...Lord William...<$FFFC>
Khe!<$FFFE>
This crystal must be the energy source supplying the Demonic Cannon.<$FFFC>
Hyaa!<$FFFE>
Excellent! In the end my plan succeeded!<$FFFC>
But we shouldn't be here when this place drops down. All units fall back!<$FFFE>
The Floating Castle is sinking!?<$FFFE>
That's not good!<$FFFC>
We have to get away from here now!<$FFFE>
No!<$FFFC>
Open your eyes papa!<$FFFE>
The crystal is under attack!<$FFFE>
No good!<$FFFC>
Don't allow them to force their way through!<$FFFE>
Understood.<$FFFC>
I entrust the crystal's safety to you!<$FFFE>
Yessir!<$FFFC>
So, this is the enemies fortress; commence the attack!<$FFFE>
The crystal is under attack!<$FFFE>
No good!<$FFFC>
You mustn't allow them to force their way through!<<$FFFE>
Understood.<$FFFC>
I entrust the crystal to you!<$FFFE>
Yessir!<$FFFC>
So, this is the enemies fortress; commence the attack!<$FFFE>
Attack the crystal!<$FFFE>
No good!<$FFFC>
Ready to head out!<$FFFE>
Understood<$FFFC>
I entrust the crystal to you!<$FFFE>
Yessir!<$FFFC>
So, this is the enemies fortress; commence the attack!<$FFFE>
In the shadow of the pillar grows a plant with magical powers.<$FFFE>
Magic Herb was obtained!<$FFFE>
A magic herb grows in a dark corner under the stairwell.<$FFFE>
Magic Herb was obtained!<$FFFE>
Such...<$FFFC>
So this is what real battle is like....<$FFFE>
You won't go any further than this!<$FFFE>
Eek!<$FFFE>
Hang in there, Tiaris!<$FFFC>
What did I do!<$FFFE>
I'm sorry....<$FFFC>
Such a burden....<$FFFE>
Leave us alone alright!<$FFFE>
Urghh!<$FFFE>
Eek!<$FFFC>
P..papa!<$FFFE>
Lord William!<$FFFE>
Milord!<$FFFE>
Grrr! Those sword skills are beyond impressive!<$FFFC>
Even my elite troop can't compare to this kind of skill!<$FFFE>
The error is all yours.<$FFFC>
Did you really think you could take the Floating Castle with this meager force?<$FFFE>
You! So, the Rigüler Field Marshal Altemüller has come himself. <$FFFD>
You shall receive due punishment for this violation!<$FFFE>
This floating castle is an eyesore to the Rigüler Empire and its desire to expand further.<$FFFC>
It is regrettable but it has to fall.<$FFFE>
You won't lay as much as a finger on it!<$FFFC>
Prepare yourself!<$FFFE>
Ghh... I didn't expect you Altemüller..<$FFFC>
to be the first, to best me in combat...<$FFFE>
So even Geriord!?<$FFFE>
Hmphh. Such foolishness.<$FFFE>
Now nothing stands between me and the crystal.<$FFFE>
I'd give my life for the ones I pledged to protect!<$FFFE>
You seem to be one of the top knights around...<$FFFC>
Tell me, how do they call you?<$FFFE>
Geriord, Knight of Larcuss.<$FFFE>
Geriord it is then.<$FFFC>
I guess you will prove a worthy opponent.<$FFFC>
You can call me Varna, General of the Rigüler Empire!<$FFFE>
I won't take your life.<$FFFC>
But you need to be punished for attempting to invading this castle!<$FFFE>
Lord William has been wounded, we have to end this battle fast!<$FFFD>
Go!<$FFFE>
Oho.<$FFFC>
You must be Geriord, the famous Knight of Larcuss.<$FFFD>
They say you are the finest warrior in these parts.<$FFFC>
You shall be an opponent worthy of myself.<$FFFC>
...Do you accept my challenge?<$FFFE>
You are the one that threw down Varna, what unexpected resistance.<$FFFD>
They say you are the finest warrior in these parts.<$FFFC>
You shall be an opponent worthy of myself.<$FFFC>
...Do you accept my challenge?<$FFFE>
Imperial Field Marshal, Altemüller.<$FFFC>
I shall accept your challenge.<$FFFE>
Imperial Field Marshal, Altemüller.<$FFFC>
You will pay with your life for what you did to the Duke!<$FFFE>
Urrgh!<$FFFE>
How did this happen?<$FFFE>
Urrgh!<$FFFE>
That can't be!<$FFFE>
I..I can't believe it...<$FFFE>
No obstacle can hold us off, force your way through!<$FFFE>
What!?<$FFFC>
You fool...<$FFFD>
To resort to such trickery, how despicable.<$FFFC>
A grand victory is to be won, that is all that matters!<$FFFE>
W-what!?<$FFFC>
I couldn't stand up to his skill...I..!<$FFFE>
It is alright Varna, fall back for now.<$FFFE>
B..but, your Excellency.....<$FFFE>
Leave the rest to me.<$FFFE>
Alright.<$FFFE>
I thought Larcuss would only rely on the Demonic Cannon's power, but it seems as if they've got some fight in them after all.<$FFFE>
Khe.....<$FFFC>
You truly are a note-worthy swordsman...<$FFFE>
Urghh!<$FFFE>
Urgh!<$FFFE>
Urggh!<$FFFE>
