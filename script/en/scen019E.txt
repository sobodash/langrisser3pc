Death of Diehärte<$FFFE>
Larcussia Defense Perimeter ~ Imperial Front-Line Base<$FFFF>
The enemy has come into sight, Sir Diehärte.<$FFFE>
Wow, that thing is huge!<$FFFE>
I've got to admit, it's pretty impressive!<$FFFE>
So this machine incapacitated father...<$FFFE>
Just keep standing right there.<$FFFC>
That way Galshook will deliver a quick and painless death to you!<$FFFE>
We won't fall for that!<$FFFE>
In that case try your luck and make your way here.<$FFFC>
It would be my pleasure to take you on personally.<$FFFE>
Just you wait!<$FFFC>
Today you'll pay for what you did to Lord Raymond!<$FFFE>
That thing emits the same energy a ruin of the ancients did that I once visited.<$FFFE>
I see.<$FFFC>
I can't even fathom the kind of knowledge that would be needed to built such a structure.<$FFFE>
Sir Diehärte.<$FFFC>
Lord Kirikaze has conveyed the information that Galshook has to reload it's magical cannon after it is fired.<$FFFD>
However, we don't know how long that pause will be exactly...<$FFFE>
But at least we will have some time to advance safely during that period of time.<$FFFE>
I think now I can guess why our troops have been defeated earlier.<$FFFD>
First Lord Raymond didn't know what he was up against and he had a huge but hard to maneuver army.<$FFFD>
Unlike his troops, we are a small number of elites.<$FFFC>
Against this foe we have to use our mobility to our advantage as much as possible.<$FFFE>
Understood.<$FFFE>
So that's the extent of the power of that giant...<$FFFD>
Is there anything you could learn that might help us?<$FFFE>
It seems as if the cannon can only be fired in a straight line.<$FFFD>
If we keep out of the direct line of fire, we should be fine.<$FFFE>
Okay.<$FFFC>
I'll make sure to keep that in mind.<$FFFE>
Those before us are all that remains of the Larcussian army.<$FFFD>
If they are defeated today, there'll be no one left to stand up against the Empire.<$FFFD>
Lend me your strength to create an empire unrivaled, so any further conflict will be obsolete!<$FFFE>
We take on that request with pleasure, General!<$FFFE>
Let's get over with this, everyone!<$FFFD>
I just hope this will go as smoothly as the battle with Lord Raymond.<$FFFE>
Don't be concerned.<$FFFC>
If needed we will gladly give our lives to claim victory for our general!<$FFFE>
Hah..., you really know how to embarrass me.<$FFFD>
But don't you lot dare to throw your lives away,<$FFFC>
after all I've gone through to save your hides.<$FFFC>
I hope you got that.<$FFFE>
Galshook, initialize start-up!<$FFFC>
All troops, prepare for battle!<$FFFC>
Make sure not to stand in line of fire!<$FFFE>
Of course, Sir.<$FFFC>
None of us have a dying wish.<$FFFE>
Hold out just a little bit longer!<$FFFC>
If we are victorious today, no one will be foolish enough to resist the Empire!<$FFFD>
When that time arrives we will taste the sweet fruits of peace,<$FFFC>
and we will return home proud of what we accomplished!<$FFFD>
Let those thoughts carry you!<$FFFE>
2nd division advance!<$FFFC>
Lure the enemy into the effective range of the cannon!<$FFFE>
You're doing quite well so far.<$FFFC>
But the real fun is just starting now!<$FFFE>
You come across two sharp edged rocks that points towards the sky.<$FFFC>
A strong magic of unknown nature can be felt from the rocks.<$FFFE>
What do you do?<$FFFE>
Dig a hole near the rock<$FFFE>
Destroy the rocks<$FFFE>
Place yourself between the rocks<$FFFE>
You dig until your arms grow tired, but nothing was found...<$FFFE>
On the impact a crack shows upon the rock,<$FFFD>
but it seems impossible to completely destroy it...<$FFFE>
The moment you step in between the rocks a sacred light flashes up.<$FFFD>
When you open your eyes again you find sparkling arrows hovering in mid air before you.<$FFFE>
Apollo's Arrow was obtained!<$FFFE>
All..this...pain...<$FFFE>
Hey death...you know right now...I gotta lots of things to do...so come back later...<$FFFE>
Father...<$FFFE>
Blasted!<$FFFE>
I should have listened to my horse...<$FFFE>
You can't imagine how painful this is for me...<$FFFE>
Sir Diehärte...<$FFFE>
Lushiris...<$FFFE>
Lushiris!<$FFFC>
Give providence to those who sinned against me!<$FFFE>
Gruuu...<$FFFE>
So this is the place you reside in, Death?<$FFFE>
I..I've waited for this day to come...<$FFFE>
General Bortz has been injured!<$FFFC>
Leave the rest to us, General!<$FFFE>
You think I would simply run like that!?<$FFFE>
If we have to defend our wounded general we can't do battle with the same effectiveness!<$FFFC>
Therefore we request that you remove yourself from the battlefield temporarily.<$FFFE>
...So that's how it is.<$FFFC>
If you think that I'm an obstacle, I'll leave.<$FFFD>
I'll fall back to Larcussia and regroup our troops there.<$FFFC>
But you've got to promise me something.<$FFFC>
...Don't die.<$FFFE>
Yessir!<$FFFE>
I hope I can rely on Galshook to save the day.<$FFFC>
Damn, I'm pathetic.<$FFFD>
Once I return to Larcussia I'll have my troops regroup and return the favor...<$FFFE>
How the hell...could I be defeated like this...<$FFFC>
Damn!<$FFFE>
I guess today was your lucky day.<$FFFC>
New orders! All troops retreat!<$FFFE>
Yes, sir!<$FFFE>
Fall back to Larcussia and regroup!<$FFFE>
Let's see how you handle yourself against my spearmanship!<$FFFE>
That's all you've got!?<$FFFC>
We won't be going down as easy as that!<$FFFE>
BZZ...Received damage exceeds capacities...<$FFFC>
All functions stopped...<$FFFE>
Even without that thing we are still far from done.<$FFFC>
As promised you'll have to put up with me from here on out!<$FFFC>
Well then, it's time to do something dark!<$FFFE>
Target acquired!<$FFFC>
Destroy them!<$FFFE>
Systems taken medicore damage.<$fe><$14><$FFFC>
.<$fe><$14>.<$fe><$14>.<$fe><$14>..<$FFFD>
Functionally remains intact.<$FFFC>
Continue Firing.<$FFFE>
Target locked on!<$FFFC>
Releasing magical charge!<$FFFD>
Magical cannon fire!<$FFFE>
Long live the Empire!<$FFFC>
Curses on Larcuss!<$FFFE>
Kyaaah!<$FFFE>
The remnants will cover the earth with blood...so the prophecy was telling the truth...<$FFFE>
I blame my utter carelessness for this...<$FFFE>
After coming so far...<$FFFE>
Hussa for the Rigüler Empire!<$FFFE>
You win, now stop!<$FFFE>
I've still got some fight left in me...<$FFFE>
Aaah...<$FFFE>
Such power...<$FFFE>
W.Why!<$FFFC>
Why did we have to fight them?<$FFFE>
Dying is not an option...<$FFFC>
Our army lies in shambles...<$FFFE>
Where has my strength gone to...<$FFFE>
It's hopeless...<$FFFE>
I can't move my body!<$FFFE>
My believes live ever on...<$FFFE>
I can't move my body!<$FFFE>
I couldn't even land a hit!<$FFFE>
I can't move my body!<$FFFE>
We have been defeated...<$FFFE>
I can't move my body!<$FFFE>
Guaarg...<$FFFE>
I can't move my body!<$FFFE>
Kluso!<$FFFE>
I can't move my body!<$FFFE>
Bastards!<$FFFE>
You'll pay for this!<$FFFC>
I know what you did!<$FFFE>
Uwaaahh!<$FFFE>
Uarrggh!<$FFFE>
I'm defeated...<$FFFE>
The Remnants of Larcuss are here...<$FFFE>
You bastards, slaughtering my subordinates like that!<$FFFE>
Dammit!<$FFFC>
But that's just fine!<$FFFD>
With just me and y'all I can go wild and release all my anger!<$FFFC>
Now come at me with all you've got!<$FFFE>
...Sir Diehärte.<$FFFC>
Wouldn't it have been enough to destroy that weapon?<$FFFD>
Pursuing other human beings like this is nothing but senseless cruelty.FFFE>
...Sir Diehärte.<$FFFC>
Wouldn't it have been enough to destroy that weapon?<$FFFD>
Pursuing other human beings like this is nothing but senseless cruelty.<$FFFE>
Keh, you really did it!<$FFFE>
It's over...<$FFFE>
You commanded brilliantly today, Sir Diehärte.<$FFFE>
Sir Diehärte....<$FFFC>
Do you even try to be serious about our mission?<$FFFD>
It surely doesn't seem that way...<$FFFE>
All troops advance!<$FFFD>
Take them out in one strike!<$FFFE>
Alright, commence the counter-attack!<$FFFD>
All troops, to the offensive!<$FFFE>
