[diehardt's name]!<$FFFC>
Where on earth did you drag us off to this time!<$FFFE>
Huh, me?<$FFFE>
Well...<$fe><$2d><$FFFE>
Who else!?<$FFFC>
Don't play the innocent!<$FFFE>
...You see...to be honest...<$FFFC>
I don't quiet understand what just happened myself.<$FFFE>
Oh my, seems like we managed to get ourselves in trouble again.<$FFFE>
!?<$FFFC>
Sir Lewin and our other companions doesn't seem to be anywhere around!<$FFFE>
Is that so...<$FFFC>
Don't you think this could be the effect of the stone the chieftain gave us?<$FFFE>
Most likely.<$FFFC>
I presume that this is what happens if you don't know how to handle it properly...<$FFFD>
It would've been better not to meddle with the unknown.<$FFFE>
I think  my father told me about this phenomenon of space-time warping.<$FFFD>
If my theory is correct, we have fallen into a loophole between the present, the past and the future...<$FFFE>
To think that such a thing would be even possible.<$FFFE>
Yeah right, and of course it's pure coincidence that [diehardt's name] ends up with all the defenseless girls alone!<$FFFE>
What do you reply?<$FFFE>
Admit it<$FFFE>
Deny it<$FFFE>
You see right through me...as always.<$FFFC>
But there's hardly anything defenseless about any of you...<$FFFE>
Aww, come on now.<$FFFC>
You of all people should know me better than that.<$FFFE>
In any case, I think it would be advisable to try to find out more about this place.<$FFFE>
Agreed.<$FFFC>
First of all, we should take a look around.<$FFFE>
Oh?<$FFFC>
It seems like we are not the only ones who were taken here.<$FFFE>
Yup.<$FFFC>
And they look like they are skilled warriors too.<$FFFE>
Who goes there?<$FFFE>
I'm Erwin.<$FFFC>
Leader of the forces of justice!<$FFFE>
What?<$FFFC>
I can't agree on that, you seem a little brazen for that position.<$FFFE>
Hah.<$FFFC>
That's rich, coming from someone stuck on level thirty-three.<$FFFD>
I, on the other hand, have reached level thirty-four weeks ago.<$FFFE>
Cut the bragging!<$FFFC>
One level is hardly enough to close the gap between the difference in talent.<$FFFE>
Nice speech.<$FFFC>
But can you back up any of that!?<$FFFE>
You have no idea what our battle-hardened troops have been through!<$FFFE>
Our Scenarios have been much more challenging than yours!<$FFFD>
No matter, we could take you on any day!<$FFFE>
It would suit you better to watch your tongue.<$FFFC>
After all, you are supposed to be my descendant. Maybe a lesson in humbleness would do you good.<$FFFE>
Hah...<$FFFC>
I also think that it's high time to let our swords take over the speaking.<$FFFD>
Liana, Cherie, let's go!<$FFFE>
Fine by me.<$FFFC>
Chris, Namu.<$FFFC>
Prepare for battle!<$FFFE>
....<$FFFC>
Interesting.<$FFFD>
As far as I understand the situation it's some kind of competition of heroes.<$FFFE>
So, what about it?<$FFFE>
Heh...<$FFFC>
I guess it's time for me to step in and show them who the real protagonist is.<$FFFE>
Boys.<$FFFC>
I just don't get them, being stuck with all that ego crap.<$FFFE>
Say, Riffany!<$FFFD>
Don't you think that those two bear a remarkable resemblance to Lewin?<$FFFE>
Hmmm...<$FFFC>
Now that you mention it, it certainly seems that way.<$FFFE>
Do you think it's possible that there's some kind of connection between them, considering that this place warps time and all?<$FFFE>
Yes, that's certainly a possibility. Who knows, maybe those two even are Lewin's direct descendants.<$FFFE>
Yeah, that's exactly what I've been thinking too.<$FFFE>
Hey now, this still is a battlefield.<$FFFC>
Could you do me a favor and take this a bit more serious?<$FFFE>
Sure, Sure.<$FFFC>
Keep your armor on, Mr.All-Important!<$FFFE>
Their respective teams only number three Commanders.<$FFFD>
We, on the other hand, are five in total.<$FFFC>
Winning against them should be no problem.<$FFFE>
I'm afraid it won't be that easy.<$FFFC>
After all, they all seem to be very experienced in the way of fighting.<$FFFE>
And so are we.<$FFFC>
If they should make the mistake to think of me as a child,<$FFFD>
they're in for a brutal beating a la Tia!<$FFFE>
<$F702><$F702>To rely on an advantage in numbers, such cowardice!<$FFFE>
Honestly!<$FFFC>
Don't you have any sense of chivalry!?<$FFFE>
<$F703><$F703>What do you reply?<$FFFE>
Do I sense jealousy?<$FFFE>
We'll reduce the number of our commanders!<$FFFE>
...How sad it must be.<$FFFC>
To be such unpopular specimen...<$FFFE>
What!?<$FFFE>
What!?<$FFFE>
...Very well.<$FFFC>
If you insist we will reduce our numbers.<$FFFE>
Please remove 2 members from the active party.<$FFFE>
Please remove 1 member from the active party.<$FFFE>
Well then, it's between you and me now.<$FFFE>
In that case, prove it.<$FFFE>
Well then, it's between you and me now.<$FFFE>
In that case, prove it.<$FFFE>
Erwin.<$FFFC>
That fellow seems to be far more ludicrously self-centred than you are.<$FFFE>
I Agree.<$FFFC>
He's quiet a bit too noisy for my taste as well.<$FFFE>
I suggest setting aside our dispute for now and put this nuisance into his place.<$FFFC>
After that, we can continue our battle undisturbed.<$FFFE>
It's a deal.<$FFFE>
Well then.<$FFFC>
The alliance has been formed!<$FFFE>
Show me the extent of your power!<$FFFE>
Show me the worth of your conviction!<$FFFE>
A most interesting turn of events.<$FFFC>
Bring it on!<$FFFE>
We answered all those questions correctly.<$FFFC>
Shouldn't we get a special reward for this?<$FFFE>
I won't lose!<$FFFE>
I won't go down without a fight!<$FFFE>
Modesty is a hero's virtue. Think of it as a chance to learn some temperance.<$FFFE>
Shouldn't you be satisfied with what you got already!?<$FFFE>
Prince.<$FFFC>
We shouldn't participate in such a meaningless battles!<$FFFE>
A man that cannot uphold his honor, wouldn't be worthy of the gaze of those he adores.<$FFFD>
Therefore, I cannot yield.<$FFFE>
Ledin...<$FFFE>
Chris.<$FFFC>
Please try to understand what this means to me.<$FFFE>
Very well, I think I understand.<$FFFC>
I will go to battle with you.<$FFFE>
Thank you, both of you.<$FFFE>
Hah, that's pretty archaic.<$FFFC>
Going to battle just to impress the girls.<$FFFE>
Right.<$FFFC>
I can't stand overbearing man like him.<$FFFE>
Well then, let's get this over with.<$FFFE>
....<$FFFE>
I hope you have braced yourself for a bit of a painful experience.<$FFFE>
That's my line.<$FFFE>
Don't blame me if you get yourself hurt!<$FFFE>
This is getting out of hand.<$FFFD>
It is time for me, the real protagonist, to step in and bring a conclusion to this rivalry.<$FFFE>
Another newcomer?<$FFFE>
You'd better stay out of this.<$FFFC>
That is if you know what's good for you!<$FFFE>
Shortly you'll come to understand.<$FFFC>
That yours is only a minor part to play in this story!<$FFFE>
Even with your new formed alliance you have no hope of victory!<$FFFD>
The real protagonist can never loose!<$FFFE>
I guess you wouldn't mind putting that theory to test then.<$FFFE>
Right.<$FFFC>
If what you're saying is true, I'd like to see what protagonists are capable of these days.<$FFFE>
Be my guest.<$FFFC>
I'm sure I will live up to your expectations!<$FFFE>
That [diehardt's name] fellow seems to be a bit full of himself.<$FFFE>
My thoughts exactly.<$FFFC>
Let's teach him a lesson in real strength!<$FFFE>
Leave it to me!<$FFFE>
Give up, this battle has already been decided!<$FFFE>
Let's see if your swordplay can keep up with your tongue!<$FFFE>
So, have you come to suffer a shameful defeat!?<$FFFE>
I'm afraid that you'll be the one to suffer!<$FFFC>
But deeds are better than words!<$FFFE>
Let's see whose skill are the most refined!<$FFFE>
It would be my pleasure!<$FFFE>
A hero needs to be knowledgeable as well. Let's see if you got what it takes.<$FFFD>
When Langrisser I was ported from MD to PC, some modifications were applied.<$FFFD>
What exactly has been modified?<$FFFE>
What has been modified?<$FFFE>
Hidden Classes were added<$FFFE>
Support magic was improved<$FFFE>
Super-Langrisser was implemented<$FFFE>
I know that.<$FFFC>
Hidden classes were added!<$FFFE>
It's the simple things...<$FFFC>
Support magic was improved!<$FFFE>
Very good.<$FFFC>
Here, consider this to be your reward.<$FFFE>
500P were obtained!<$FFFE>
However, you still have to prove your skill with the blade, so don't get haughty just yet!<$FFFE>
I know that.<$FFFC>
They introduced the Super-Langrisser!<$FFFE>
Alright, this is a question related to myself.<$FFFC>
What happened to me at the ending of our story?<$FFFE>
What became of Chris?<$FFFE>
She was sacrificed to Chaos<$FFFE>
Flew off on a Pegasus<$FFFE>
She married Ledin<$FFFE>
That's not really a difficult question.<$FFFC>
You've been sacrificed to Chaos.<$FFFE>
Wrong answer.<$FFFE>
You lost 200P!<$FFFE>
That's not really a difficult question.<$FFFC>
You flew off on a Pegasus to serve Lushiris in the heavens.<$FFFE>
Wrong. You've got an overly active imagination.<$FFFE>
You lost 500P!<$FFFE>
Naturally you got married to Ledin!<$FFFC>
That's gotta be it!<$FFFE>
...Right!<$FFFD>
That's the correct answer.<$FFFC>
You may have this.<$FFFE>
Cross was obtained!<$FFFE>
Is that not the cross you threw around when you were on a rampage?<$FFFE>
It certainly is.<$FFFC>
Ah, what nostalgia.<$FFFE>
I'm a bit surprised you would keep that in good memory.<$FFFC>
One has to go to such lengths in the name of harmony.<$FFFE>
...Right!<$FFFC>
That's the correct answer.<$FFFE>
Please try to answer my question correctly.<$FFFC>
Who is the man my heart yearns for?<$FFFE>
Who does Namu like the most?<$FFFE>
Ledin<$FFFE>
Lance<$FFFE>
[diehardt's name]<$FFFE>
That's easy.<$FFFC>
It has to be Ledin!<$FFFE>
Certainly, the prince is nothing to sneeze at...but...<$FFFE>
Namu...you couldn't mean!?<$FFFC>
But you must know..I..<$FFFE>
Ledin!<$FFFE>
I'm sorry.<$FFFC>
I was caught off guard.<$FFFE>
My apologies, Prince.<$FFFE>
Don't worry about it...<$FFFE>
Anyhow, your answer was wrong. Please pay the due fee.<$FFFE>
You lost 200P<$FFFE>
L.A.N.C.E!<$FFFE>
Noooo!<$FFFC>
Such embarrassment...<$FFFD>
I mean, correct answer.<$FFFC>
This shall suffice as your reward.<$FFFE>
Assault Suit was obtained!<$FFFE>
What!?<$FFFE>
Excuse me, I must have confused the items.<$FFFC>
Have this instead.<$FFFE>
Wisdom Fruit was obtained!<$FFFE>
I think you will find this to be most useful to you, since it improves intelligence.<$FFFE>
That's easy.<$FFFC>
It has to be......ME!!<$FFFE>
I'm sorry , but personally I'm not too fond of guys with hair resembling a palm tree.<$FFFC>
Anyhow, your answer was wrong. Please pay the due fee.<$FFFE>
You lost 200P...and a portion of your confidence...<$FFFE>
Being the true protagonist, you won't have any trouble answering my question, right?<$FFFD>
Who was the last boss I had to <$FFFE>
Who was the final boss?<$FFFE>
Bernhardt<$FFFE>
Chaos<$FFFE>
Böser<$FFFE>
It was Kaiser Bernhardt.<$FFFE>
I guess this was a bit too easy.<$FFFD>
But it's fine.<$FFFC>
Take this.<$FFFE>
Valor Seed was obtained!<$FFFE>
I gotta admit your not half bad at answering questions,<$FFFD>
but now it's time to see what you can do in battle!<$FFFE>
You already have picked that answer before.<$FFFD>
Those poor tactics will get you nowhere!<$FFFE>
The last boss had to be Chaos!<$FFFE>
That would've been Böser!<$FFFE>
Perhaps this question is a bit difficult, but try your best to answer it.<$FFFD>
What happened to the Langrisser at the end of our story?<$FFFE>
What happened to the holy blade?<$FFFE>
It disappeared along with Alhazard<$FFFE>
It was sealed again.<$FFFE>
It was returned to the goddess<$FFFE>
It disappeared along with Alhazard<$FFFD>
and it hasn't been seen again ever after.<$FFFE>
That is correct.<$FFFC>
You prove to be quiet knowledgeable after all.<$FFFD>
Please accept this as a reward.<$FFFE>
Protection Fruit was obtained!<$FFFE>
That is correct.<$FFFC>
You prove to be quiet knowledgeable after all.<$FFFE>
I guess It was sealed again...<$FFFE>
I It was returned to the goddess...<FFFE>
Time for my question!<$FFFC>
I'm a princess, but which Kingdom do I come from?<$FFFE>
Where's Cherie a princess?<$FFFE>
Night Club<$FFFE>
Kalxath<$FFFE>
Baldea<$FFFE>
...A night club...<$FFFC>
...Those clothes leave no doubt about that...<$FFFE>
Son of a...!<$FFFC>
Grr! You brought this one on yourself!<$FFFE>
Cherie kicked you in the balls...you also lost 1000P...<$FFFE>
In that case, you must be the princess of Kalxath.<$FFFC>
A descendant of Lance and Namu.<$FFFE>
Bingo.<$FFFC>
Here you go, this should buff you up somewhat.<$FFFE>
Power Fruit was obtained!<$FFFE>
Bingo.<$FFFE>
Um, I guess it's Baldea?<$FFFE>
Close, but not quiet there.<$FFFC>
The Kingdom of Baldea pretty much didn't exist any longer during my period.<$FFFD>
I'm afraid you'll have to pay for answering wrong.<$FFFE>
You lost 200P.<$FFFE>
You come across a cluster of huge stones positioned in a circular manner. <$FFFD>
It seems to be man-made, but its specific uses are a mystery to you.<$FFFE>
What do you want to do?<$FFFE>
Communicate with the outside world<$FFFE>
Offer up a sacrifice<$FFFE>
Search for hidden treasure<$FFFE>
<$f6>Guardian<$fc>You shout like mad and try sending over thoughts to the outside world.<$FFFC>
<$fe><$14>.<$fe><$14>.<$fe><$14>.<$fe><$14>.<$fe><$14>..<$FFFD>
But there was no reply...<$FFFE>
Do you want to make a sacrifice?<$FFFE>
What do you want to offer up?<$FFFE>
A Prayer<$FFFE>
Saintly Animal<$FFFE>
Your own blood<$FFFE>
<$f6>Guardian<$fc>You lower your head and offer up a silent prayer...<$FFFD>
But nothing happens...<$FFFE>
But Jügler was not in range of your treacherous hands.<$FFFD>
Suddenly a voice echoes through your mind.<$FFFD>
"It's the thought that counts. Take this as a sign of my appreciation."<$FFFE>
Staff of the Dragon Lord was obtained!<$FFFE>
You take out a knife, cut your finger a little and let the blood drop on the ground.<$FFFD>
Suddenly a voice echoes through your mind.<$FFFD>
"I accept. You shall have this as prove of our covenant."<$FFFE>
Blood Pact was obtained!<$FFFE>
<$f6>Guardian<$fc>You lost 10 HP.<$FFFE>
You search the surroundings but come away empty handed...<$FFFE>
Absurd!<$FFFC>
I'm the protagonist...this has to be...a mistake...<$FFFE>
This is my time to shine!<$FFFE>
Yeooow, Ouchy!<$FFFE>
Aahh...<$FFFE>
Uuuu...<$FFFC>
Forgive me, Sir [diehardt's name]...<$FFFE>
Lushiris keeps me safe...<$FFFE>
Forgive me.<$FFFC>
Prolonging this battle would be foolish.<$FFFD>
Let us retreat.<$FFFE>
Now I understand...<$FFFC>
It is time to leave matters to the next generation...<$FFFE>
Your both, knowledgeable and strong.<$FFFE>
Thank you.<$FFFC>
I think you are a worthy predecessor...<$FFFE>
If only I could've done more to assist...<$FFFE>
Admitting defeat at times can only temper oneself...<$FFFE>
I won't leave the protection of the world in the hands of someone incapable!<$FFFC>
Show me what you're made off, Erwin!<$FFFE>
Here I go!<$FFFE>
Oh...Ledin...<$FFFE>
Forgive me!<$FFFD>
Prince...<$FFFE>
I have lost...<$FFFC>
I'm sorry, Cherie, Liana...<$FFFE>
I have been defeated...<$FFFC>
Guess I wasn't the protagonist after all...<$FFFE>
Your both, knowledgeable and strong.<$FFFE>
Thanks.<$FFFC>
I think you are a worthy predecessor...<$FFFE>
Erwin...<$FFFE>
At last this meaningless battle is over.<$FFFC>
What a relief...<$FFFE>
I beg your pardon, Erwin.<$FFFC>
Please don't do anything reckless while I'm not around...<$FFFE>
Ouch!<$FFFC>
Time to withdraw!<$FFFE>
You'd better be ready for this!<$FFFE>
Heh...<$FFFC>
Just as I thought.<$FFFD>
This was the only possible outcome.<$FFFE>
I presume now would be a good time to think of a way to return to our world...<$FFFE>
I guess now would be a good time to think of a way to return to our world.<$FFFE>
Right, there are still a lot of things we have to take care of!<$FFFE>
Yes...<$FFFE>
You did it before, you should at least have a vague idea how to get us back, right?<$FFFE>
Sorry.<$FFFC>
I have no idea.<$FFFE>
I, however, have no idea how to get back.<$FFFE>
<$F704><$F704>Hmm.<$FFFC>
It certainly would be nice if it was that simple.<$FFFC>
Well then, please oh mighty stone take us back to our world...<$FFFD>
And<$fe><$28>.<$fe><$28>.<$fe><$28>.where still here...<$FFFE>
<$F705><$F705>We have to face reality.<$FFFD>
It's no use.<$FFFC>
We'll never make it back...home...<$FFFE>
Remove Tiaris?<$FFFE>
Thanks, at least I don't have to be part of all this stupidity that way!<$FFFE>
Remove Riffany?<<$FFFE>
I apologize for being a hindrance to you.<$FFFC>
If you'll excuse me.<$FFFE>
Remove Luna?<$FFFE>
How unfortunate.<$FFFC>
I had looked forward to do battle against those peculiar opponents...<$FFFE>
Remove Sophia?<$FFFE>
I understand.<$FFFC>
I'll withdraw for now.<$FFFE>
Alright, we have equal numbers now!<$FFFC>
May the best prevail!<$FFFE>
Not a chance, I'll never get tired of saying this.<$FFFC>
I'm the protagonist around here!<$FFFE>
How foolish!<$FFFC>
To belief you could fool me by picking the same choice twice!<$FFFD>
Now, pay up!<$FFFE>
You lost 200P<$FFFE>
Hah...<$FFFC>
So that's the extend of your knowledge...<$FFFD>
You'll have to pay dearly for picking the wrong answer!<$FFFE>
You lost 200P!<$FFFE>
That is incorrect.<$FFFC>
Please pay up.<$FFFE>
You lost 200P<$FFFE>
Secret Stone of the Hero was obtained!<$FFFE>
To rely on an advantage in numbers, such cowardice!<$FFFC>
Do you have no sense of chivalry at all!?<$FFFE>
Ganging up on us with five commanders is quiet a cheap strategy.<$FFFD>
You still have a long way to go.<$FFFE>
Actually, I think it's quiet simple.<$FFFC>
Try holding the stone like before and focus your mind on returning to our original world.<$FFFE>
Please don't give up so soon.<$FFFD>
If we keep on trying I'm sure we'll make it back somehow.<$FFFE>
<$FFFF>
