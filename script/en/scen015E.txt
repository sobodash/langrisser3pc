The Road leading to Estool Ruins<$FFFF>
General Dios, please stop!<$FFFE>
Dang!<$FFFC>
They've caught up with me already?<$FFFE>
The Barral Kingdom needs your prows as a General!<$FFFE>
You seem doing fine with that Dark Knight no?<$FFFD>
I retire as a general.<$FFFC>
I've had it with this place.<$FFFE>
Come to your senses.<$FFFC>
Do you think you can run away forever?<$FFFD>
If you return now King Wilder will reappoint you surely.<$FFFC>
That's why...<$FFFE>
Don't make me laugh!<$FFFC>
You don't really think the king would just let this slide like this!?<$FFFE>
Besides, I won't follow the orders of a king that has gone completely mad for another minute.<$FFFE>
Your behavior is inexcusable, Dios.<$FFFE>
P..Princess...<$FFFE>
Father's goodwill is almost exhausted, this is the last chance for you to reconsider.<$FFFE>
Princess.<$FFFC>
Do you really think he would show mercy?<$FFFE>
Not even a fragment is left of the once kind King Wilder I pledged my loyalty to.<$FFFE>
General...<$FFFE>
He once was a king that a soldier could look up to.<$FFFC>
Therefore, I have to go, for the kings sake.<$FFFE>
Just take one look at the current state of the Kingdom.<$FFFC>
He only cares about his selfish ambitions, he has become a total stranger to me.<$FFFE>
Right now he is nothing but a human beast that is to be loathed!<$FFFE>
..Just to make sure I understood correctly.<$FFFC>
You are not willing to turn back?<$FFFE>
Damn straight!<$FFFC>
From now on I'll live on my own volition.<$FFFE>
Then you leave me no choice.<$FFFC>
You are hereby judged being guilty of treason against the king!<$FFFE>
Barral troops!<$FFFC>
What could they be doing here?<$FFFE>
Something rather strange must be occurring.<$FFFE>
There seems to be a dispute between Princess Flaire and General Dios.<$FFFE>
You know them?<$FFFE>
It is crucial for a tactician to know the most important persons of various countries.<$FFFE>
Don't you remember!?<$FFFC>
It's the guy we fought when we were fleeing from Laffel.<$FFFE>
Oh yeah!<$FFFC>
I wonder why he's in a quarrel with Flaire?<$FFFE>
All troops, arrest the traitor Dios!<$FFFE>
You won't get me that easy!<$FFFE>
Seize him! Don't let him get away!<$FFFE>
We should help him.<$FFFE>
Fighting Flaire?<$FFFE>
Yes.<$FFFC>
As of now we are still enemies.<$FFFE>
If we leave them be, they will get in our way sooner or later.<$FFFE>
Furthermore, that Barral General could give us some valuable information about the Kingdom's internals.<$FFFE>
It seems this course of action would be best.<$FFFE>
You're right.<$FFFC>
Everyone, move out and protect that General!<$FFFE>
Princess!<$FFFC>
Remnants of the Larcussian army are heading this way!<$FFFE>
What is the meaning of this!?<$FFFD>
Capturing Dios takes first priority!<$FFFC>
Retaliate if the enemy makes their move!<$FFFE>
Understood!<$FFFE>
I'm sorry but I won't be much of a help.<$FFFC>
For now I'll just run straight, I'm tired of all this.<$FFFE>
Don't worry about it.<$FFFC>
Leave the Barral soldiers to us.<$FFFE>
...Okay.<$FFFC>
Thanks.<$FFFE>
After all the general won't return to us.<$FFFE>
I can't believe it.<$FFFC>
Pursue him.<$FFFC>
I will move in from the other side!<$FFFE>
You advance from mid air.<$FFFE>
In the name of the the Barral naval battalion protect the princess!<$FFFD>
Charge!<$FFFE>
Please come quietly General Dios!<$FFFC>
Don't force us to get rough with you.<$FFFE>
If you feel bad about it just leave me be alright!<$FFFE>
You know we can't do that!<$FFFE>
All troops move out!<$FFFC>
Repel the remnants of Larcuss!<$FFFE>
Flaire!<$FFFE>
You are General Dios aren't you?<$FFFE>
I'm no longer a general.<$FFFC>
I can't approve of King Wilder's methods any more, therefore I retired.<$FFFE>
Then...<$FFFE>
You've guessed it..<$FFFC>
I'm a common deserter now.<$FFFE>
I see.<$FFFC>
So that's why they are after you.<$FFFC>
Maybe we could lend a hand?<$FFFE>
Sure be my guest, but be careful.<$FFFD>
Other than the Larcussian army that relied on the Demonic Cannon, the Barral troops haven't neglected their training.<$FFFE>
I know.<$FFFC>
I once was close to the royal family...Flaire...<$FFFE>
Stop interfering, Diehärte.<$FFFC>
We are only here to arrest the traitor Dios.<$FFFD>
Hand him over!<$FFFE>
What do you reply?<$FFFE>
We won't.<$FFFE>
Lower your sword Flair.<$FFFE>
You'll have to get him by force.<$FFFE>
That's not an option.<$FFFC>
We won't abandon another human to die.<$FFFE>
I see.<$FFFC>
In that case you leave me no choice but to use force.<$FFFE>
Lower your sword Flaire.<$FFFC>
There's no desire within me to fight with you!<$FFFE>
...What a strange sensation.<$FFFC>
When you're talking to me like this I feel memories of the past submerging.<$FFFD>
But now we are enemies.<$FFFC>
My feelings for you have no place on the battlefield!<$FFFE>
Flaire!?<$FFFE>
Over my dead body!<$FFFD>
You'll have to go through me first if you want him!<$FFFE>
So be it!<$FFFD>
Your just any other opponent to me.<$FFFC>
If that's what it takes I'll deliver death to you personally!<$FFFE>
Remnants of the Larcussian army sighted!<$FFFD>
The enemy is upon us!<$FFFE>
Attention.<$FFFC>
There are Barral troops on the island up ahead!<$FFFE>
Please proceed with caution.<$FFFC>
It would be disadvantageous to do battle in the water!<$FFFE>
Huh!?<$FFFD>
The enemy has broken through our defensive lines!<$FFFE>
Phew, it sure feels good to have made it.<$FFFE>
Thanks to those guys.<$FFFC>
I need to take a day of.<$FFFE>
That was my intention but I guess we could sort out this mess together.<$FFFD>
I want to join you.<$FFFE>
Will that be alright?<$FFFC>
You know that this means to fight against Barral?<$FFFE>
It makes me a bit sad,<$FFFD>
but I think I can handle it.<$FFFC>
Alright then, let's hear it.<$FFFC>
I'll follow your orders.<$FFFE>
What are your orders?<$FFFE>
Attack the enemy<$FFFE>
Wait<$FFFE>
Leave decision to him<$FFFC>
Attacking the enemy would be helpful!<$FFFE>
Gotcha.<$FFFC>
Battle is my forte anyway!<$FFFE>
Don't exhaust yourself.<$FFFC>
In that case I'll take a break.<$FFFE>
Thanks.<$FFFE>
They are driving us back into a corner, what are they up to...<$FFFE>
While making your way through the bushes you come across a spear sticking in a rock.<$FFFD>
The spear is entwined with ivy?<$FFFE>
What do you want to do?<$FFFE>
Cut it with your sword<$FFFE>
Remove it by hand<$FFFE>
Ignore it<$FFFE>
You damaged the spear somewhat, but it still was possible to get it.<$FFFE>
Lance was obtained!<$FFFE>
You gently remove the ivy with your hands with success.<$FFFE>
Zuftaf was obtained!<$FFFE>
After a while the spear disappears into thin air.<$FFFE>
Keh...<$FFFC>
Flaire...<$FFFE>
Kyaa!<$FFFC>
Hitsudoitsu!<$FFFC>
How cruel!<$FFFE>
I can't breath.<$FFFC>
No power is left in this body...<$FFFE>
Craaap!<$FFFC>
Going down like this...how regrettable...<$FFFE>
My..power seems to be insufficient...<$FFFE>
Damn, just my luck...<$FFFC>
Forgive me, Sir Diehärte...<$FFFE>
Well...<$FFFC>
May Lushiris watch over you all...<$FFFE>
I liked you better before you let me die...<$FFFE>
Uuuuh...<$FFFC>
I'm finished...<$FFFE>
Grrrrr...<$FFFC>
I'm sorry...<$FFFE>
You won't get me without a fight!<$FFFE>
Damn!<$FFFC>
There is no escape...<$FFFE>
General Dios!<$FFFE>
The traitor has been caught!<$FFFC>
We have no more reason to stay here.<$FFFD>
All troops retreat!<$FFFE>
My..power wasn't sufficient!?<$FFFC>
Keh!<$FFFE>
Keh...<$FFFC>
How could I...<$FFFE>
Princess!<$FFFC>
Please retreat.<$FFFC>
We will stall the enemy...<$FFFE>
There aren't enough troops left to win this battle...<$FFFC>
Everyone, retreat...<$FFFE>
..If that is your wish.<$FFFC>
Understood.<$FFFE>
Diehärte!<$FFFC>
One day I'll return this favor!<$FFFE>
Keh...<$FFFC>
One day I'll return this favor!<$FFFE>
...Flaire...<$FFFE>
Sir Diehärte, you did commendable.<$FFFC>
We should hurry on ahead.<$FFFE>
Sir Diehärte...<$FFFC>
You're commanding was ridiculous.<$FFFD>
I'm ashamed to serve you...<$FFFE>
So, where are you all are heading to?<$FFFE>
We are on our way to the Estool ruins to claim a sword that banishes evil.<$FFFD>
But what will you do from here on out General Dios?<$FFFE>
Hey now, I already said I retired as a general.<$FFFC>
Simply Dios is fine.<$FFFD>
From what I understand you are concerned about King Wilder too.<$FFFD>
For now I think I'll join your cause.<$FFFC>
Also that's my way to say thanks.<$FFFE>
　<$FFFC>
Dios joined the party!<$FFFE>
That's reassuring, Dios.<FFFC>
Welcome on board.<$FFFE>
I simply cannot understand your actions.<$FFFC>
But I'll stop this madness even if I have to use force!<$FFFE>
Interesting.<$FFFC>
Give it a try!<$FFFE>
Urgh, my supreme spear technique was useless..<$FFFE>
My sniping was useless...<$FFFE>
I was getting careless...<$FFFE>
Kyaaah!<$FFFE>
I can still fight...<$FFFE>
Curses!<$FFFC>
Troops from Larcuss have arrived!<$FFFE>
Arrest the general fast...<$FFFE>
Dammit!<$FFFC>
Troops from Larcuss have arrived!<$FFFE>
Why...<$FFFC>
Sky...Aaargh!<$FFFE>
This is too cruel!<$FFFE>
Uarrgh!<$FFFE>
I thought I'd be invincible in the water....<$FFFE>
Absurd!<$FFFE>
General Dios, thank you for teaching me...<$FFFE>
My beloved mount...Fare thee well...<$FFFE>
Uwaaa!<$FFFE>
For what reason...do I...have to die here...<$FFFE>
Princessaaargh!<$FFFE>
General...<$FFFE>
My magic has failed me...<$FFFE>
Urgh...this has to be a bad dream...<$FFFE>
I don't want to die!<$FFFE>
That cannot be...<$FFFC>
All my troops have been defeated!?<$FFFE>
Please stop this, Flaire!<$FFFE>
Silence!<$FFFC>
Even if I'm on my own I'll fight to the end!<$FFFE>
What do you say?<$FFFE>
Calm her down<$FFFE>
Stand up against her<$FFFE>
Ask her about her reason for fighting<$FFFE>
Calm down, Flaire!<$FFFC>
Any more fighting is pointless!<$FFFE>
You'll have to do better than this!<$FFFC>
I won't be swayed so easily!<$FFFE>
If that's what you want.<$FFFC>
You'd better brace yourself!<$FFFE>
You should not take me lightly Diehärte!<$FFFE>
Wait.<$FFFC>
I don't want to fight you Flaire.<$FFFD>
And I don't understand why we have to do battle!<$FFFC>
What is your reason behind this!?<$FFFE>
There is no particular reason!<$FFFC>
It is solely for whom I was born that we have come to such odds.<$FFFE>
I wasn't asked for agreement neither,<$FFFD>
or if Barral should invade Larcuss.<$FFFC>
What if there is no further reason for all of this!?<$FFFE>
I'm still the princess of Barral!<$FFFC>
If the king orders to invade Larcuss, I have no choice but to do so!<$FFFD>
You and I are enemies.<$FFFC>
There is nothing but battle for us to do!<$FFFE>
As I'm expected to,<$FFFD>
I simply follow the orders of my father.<$FFFE>
Princess!<$FFFD>
Our troops stationed on the island have been wiped out!<$FFFE>
...As I expected of you Diehärte.<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
If only we wouldn't have to be enemies...<$FFFE>
Prin..cess?<$FFFE>
Never mind that.<$FFFD>
Well then!<$FFFC>
Scatter the advancing enemies and seize the traitor Dios!<$FFFD>
We cannot allow the honor of the Barral Kingdom to be soiled like that!<$FFFC>
Move out cautiously!<$FFFE>
Yessir!<$FFFE>
The units stationed on the island have been wiped out!?<$FFFD>
Protect the princess at all cost!<$FFFC>
Even if you have to sacrifice your lives for her majesty!<$FFFE>
Understood!<$FFFE>
