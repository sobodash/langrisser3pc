...Geriord asked me to give this keepsake to his beloved, Layla.<$FFFE>
Th..that's!<$FFFC>
The pendant I gave him...<$FFFE>
Take it as a memento.<$FFFE>
Geriord's last wish was for you to find happiness...he's dead.<$FFFE>
...Geriord...<$FFFE>
Well then, my time has almost run out...<$FFFC>
I should not stay here any longer.<$FFFC>
Once we were enemies but let us part as friends.<$FFFE>
Thank you for keeping your promise to come back and protect Laffel.<$FFFE>
You have become a sublime knight.<$FFFC>
I compliment you...<$FFFE>
...Geriord...<$FFFE>
Farewell...<$FFFE>
That night<$FFFF>
‥<$fe><$3c>‥<$fe><$3c>‥<$fe><$3c>‥。<$FFFC>
Tomorrow we'll make our way to the imperial capitol.<$FFFE>
This will be the decisive battle...<$FFFC>
...Maybe not all of us will return alive...<$FFFE>
We only made it this far because everyone joined their strength.<$FFFE>
Thus...<$FFFE>
Which one of those do you prefer?<$FFFE>
A Woman<$FFFE>
A Man<$FFFE>
Who is the women that enthralls your heart?<$FFFE>
Tiaris<$FFFE>
Riffany<$FFFE>
Luna<$FFFE>
Sophia<$FFFE>
Flaire<$FFFE>
Who is the women that enthrals your heart?<$FFFE>
Tiaris<$FFFE>
Riffany<$FFFE>
Luna<$FFFE>
Sophia<$FFFE>
Flaire<$FFFE>
...Flaire...<$FFFD>
I wasn't strong enough to save you..<$FFFC>
Hopefully you don't need to feel pain anymore, wherever you are now...<$FFFE>
....<$FFFC>
Know that I will never forget, what you gave your life for...<$FFFE>
Tomorrow we will seal away the evil sword of the demon tribe, that is the cause for all of this...<$FFFD>
Watch over me, Flaire...<$FFFE>
Do you want to confess your love to her?<$FFFE>
...I don't want any regrets.<$FFFE>
...No.<$FFFC>
We just have an important battle before us.<$FFFC>
And I wouldn't want to discompose her.<$FFFE>
I have to keep those feelings locked up in my heart a little while longer.<$FFFD>
....<$FFFE>
...Tiaris.<$FFFE>
<$ff><$fa>...<$FFFE>
...Well, already asleep are we?<$FFFC>
How unfortunate, and yet I feel relived in some way.<$FFFE>
<$ff><$fa>...U..m,<$FFFC>
<$ff><$f9>who's there?<$FFFE>
Ah, sorry.<$FFFC>
Did I wake you up?<$FFFE>
No, it's alright,<$FFFC>
...but what's the matter?<$FFFE>
Eh, emmm...<$FFFC>
It's just that...<$FFFE>
Hm?<$FFFE>
How do I best put it...<$FFFE>
What?<$FFFE>
Tiaris.<$FFFC>
I...love you!<$FFFE>
Ehh!?<$FFFE>
I love you.<$FFFC>
This was not the best time to say something like this,<$FFFC>
that I understand.<$FFFE>
However, I had to speak my mind before tomorrow.<$FFFC>
...Therefore you had to know how I feel about you...<$FFFE>
...<$FFFE> 
I, I'm so sorry!<$FFFC>
Blurting out something weird like that!<$FFFE>
...Ah....um<$FFFE>
Ehh!?<$FFFE>
I like you very much too.<$FFFC>
...No, I loved you all this time.<$FFFE>
Ever since you came to start your training with papa.<$FFFE>
...Tiaris.<$FFFE>
How dreamlike.<$FFFC>
I always thought you would only think of me as a little sister...<$FFFE>
At the beginning I thought of you that way. However, little by little I recognized that you are more to me than that.<$FFFE>
You are the irreplaceable woman for me.<$FFFC>
I love you, Tiaris.<$FFFE>
...I love you too...<$FFFE>
...Ahahah!<$FFFE>
Ti..Tiaris?<$FFFE>
That was the best joke so far!<$FFFE>
Jo..Joke...<$FFFE>
You did it to make me feel easy about tomorrow's battle didn't you?<$FFFD>
I'm alright, Brother!<$FFFE>
...Brother...<$FFFE>
That's right.<$FFFC>
[diehardt's name] you're like family to me!<$FFFD>
I can always rely on you!<$FFFE>
O,oh!<$FFFC>
I leave everything in your care!<$FFFD>
...Well, see you tomorrow then, good night.<$FFFE>
Good night, brother!<$FFFE>
...So I'm just a brother to her, huh?<$FFFE>
My, what brings you here at such an hour?<$FFFE>
Hey, Riffany.<$FFFC>
Don't we have a wonderful moonlit night tonight?<$FFFE>
That's certainly true.<$FFFC>
At such a night one could hear the howling of the werewolf.<$FFFE>
....<$FFFE>
What seems to be the matter?<$FFFE>
Was there something else you wanted to talk to me about?<$FFFE>
Ehh..Well..<$FFFC>
As a matter of fact there is something I wanted to talk to you about.<$FFFE>
With me?<$FFFC>
Hm, what could that possibly be?<$FFFE>
...Riffany.<$FFFE>
Yes?<$FFFE>
To be honest, I...<$FFFE>
Please speak clearly...<$FFFE>
I love you.<$FFFC>
Riffany...<$FFFE>
....<$FFFE>
I say it as any number of times.<$FFFC>
I'm so very fond of you.<$FFFC>
I love you with all of my heart.<$FFFE>
What a delightful sensation.<$FFFC>
How I have longed for you to say this, ever since the first time we meet.<$FFFE>
From whence you saved me from the Empire, <$FFFC>
I had  a premonition that one day those words would pass your lips.<$FFFE>
I'm so glad...you didn't reject me, I couldn't have taken the pain.<$FFFE>
Well, I didn't believe you could be hurt by anything.<$FFFC>
My valiant Knight in shining armor.<$FFFE>
Hey now, I'm a sensitive being too.<$FFFE>
Hihihi.<$FFFC>
Even so, please continue to come to my rescue in the future.<$FFFE>
Gotcha. I promise.<$FFFE>
I will protect you no matter what.<$FFFC>
Riffany...<$FFFE>
No way, did you just hear the werewolf just now!?<$FFFC>
He undoubtedly plans to eat me alive!<$FFFE>
...Riffany...<$FFFE>
Apropos eating, I need to prepare some meals for tomorrow.<$FFFE>
...Um...<$FFFE>
We can't do battle on an empty stomach, can we?<$FFFC>
Yeah, I can't disagree to that!<$FFFC>
Then give me a hand!<$FFFE>
...Oh boy.<$FFFE>
My, what's the matter?<$FFFC>
Did I see a werewolf just over there?<$FFFE>
It seems I'm not considered an object for romance...<$FFFD>
Hey now.<$FFFC>
We may have some spare time for that kind of joke after the battle tomorrow...<$FFFE>
I'm lucky.<$FFFC>
She is still awake.<$FFFE>
Oh,[diehardt's name].<$FFFC>
I'm thinking of a strategy for our battle against Velzeria tomorrow.<$FFFE>
Luna.<$FFFC>
Up until now you have worked so hard.<$FFFE>
Without you we couldn't have made it this far.<$FFFE>
What's the matter, why are you being so formal?<$FFFE>
Say nothing, please just listen.<$FFFE>
...Okay.<$FFFE>
...Sometimes it's hard to say something no matter how hard you try...<$FFFE>
No, let me put it bluntly.<$FFFE>
...Yes.<$FFFE>
Luna, I love!<$FFFE>
....<$FFFE>
It's the honest truth.<$FFFC>
I love you with all my heart.<$FFFE>
...Th..That can't, me...<$FFFE>
I'm just a tactician, unwomanly at that...<$FFFE>
That's not true!<$FFFC>
You are plenty woman.<$FFFE>
I can say that without any doubt!<$FFFE>
You don't mean it....Hihi...<$FFFE>
...What is your reply?<$FFFE>
...Um, I don't know how to find romantic words well, but...<$FFFE>
I'm also very fond of you...<$FFFE>
...I love you too...<$FFFE>
...That was wonderful.<$FFFC>
With such an encouragement my body is already itching for the battle tomorrow.<$FFFE>
...We will be victorious without fail!<$FFFE>
...Yes...<$FFFE>
...Did you just say something?<$FFFE>
Eh?<$FFFE>
Tomorrow will be decisive battle, please make sure to give your body plenty of rest.<$FFFC>
Going to bed early will improve your commanding abilities.<$FFFE>
Eh, but...<$FFFE>
It's alright.<$FFFC>
I'll take care of all preparations.<$FFFE>
....<$FFFE>
Sleep well, commander.<$FFFE>
I guess my timing was kinda bad....or I'm just a failure...<$FFFE>
Lushiris, goddess of light please grant us your protection.<$FFFC>
And please protect the one most dear to me...<$FFFE>
Huh, who's there!?<$FFFE>
I, I'm so sorry.<$FFFC>
It's just me...<$FFFC>
It wasn't my intention to be eavesdropping...<$FFFE>
...Um...so you heard me?<$FFFE>
...Sorry.<$FFFE>
...<$FFFE>
Forgive me!<$FFFC>
I won't do it again!<$FFFE>
...So long.<$FFFE>
Wait!<$FFFE>
Eh?<$FFFE>
U,umm...<$FFFE>
...This may be not the best time for it,<$FFFE>
but please listen to what I have to say.<$FFFE>
Sophia, I...<$FFFE>
Please listen closely,<$FFFC>
for it takes all of my courage to say it.<$FFFE>
No, don't trouble yourself any further, I will speak from here on.<$FFFE>
I love you.<$FFFE>
...This is not a dream is it...?<$FFFE>
It is no dream.<$FFFC>
Look at me, I'm right here by your side.<$FFFE>
Ahhh, is this really true?<$FFFC>
Can I believe it?<$FFFE>
I cherish you more than anything else, Sophia.<$FFFC>
I love you.<$FFFE>
I love you too.<$FFFC>
...This feels just like a wonderful dream...<$FFFE>
...Was that what you came to say?<$FFFE>
That..was...<$FFFE>
I don't understand what are you getting at?<$FFFE>
The person...most dear to you...<$FFFE>
Please just forget about that!<$FFFE>
Alright, I'll forget!<$FFFC>
...But answer me one question.<$FFFD>
Who is the person most dear to you, if not me?<$FFFE>
...How regrettable...<$FFFE>
Hahaha, so that's how it is.<$FFFD>
I'll just have to getting over it.<$FFFC>
Don't misunderstand!<$FFFE>
It is not that I dislike you..<$FFFC>
I hold you in rather high esteem...<$FFFD>
But,...<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
I'm sorry...<$FFFE>
You don't need to apologize for that...<$FFFE>
...Just forget what I said...<$FFFC>
The pain from rejection hurts the most...<$FFFE>
Humph!<$FFFC>
Ha!<$FFFE>
Here you are Flaire.<$FFFE>
Oh, you've been watching?<$FFFC>
...It seems that somehow I'm unable to sleep.<$FFFE>
Heh, same here.<$FFFE>
Ah, so such a thing can befall even someone like you?<$FFFE>
Now your making me feel terrible.<$FFFE>
Hihihi, I'm joking.<$FFFE>
Sheesh!<$FFFE>
...How nostalgic.<$FFFC>
Watching the moon with you like this.<$FFFE>
That's right.<$FFFC>
In the old days we had a good time doing this together.<$FFFE>
...Well, Flaire.<$FFFC>
Please just listen and don't laugh.<$FFFE>
What's the matter, why are you being so uptight all of a sudden?<$FFFE>
Long ago I vowed to you that I would become a knight<$FFFC>
and a splendid one at that.<$FFFE>
I remember.<$FFFE>
As promised I became a knight.<$FFFE>
But whether I'm a fine knight or not I do not know.<$FFFE>
You are a wonderful one.<$FFFE>
Thank you.<$FFFC>
When you say it with such confidence I can believe it too.<$FFFE>
I love you.<$FFFE>
!!<$FFFE>
What do you say?<$FFFC>
In what way do you think about me?<$FFFE>
...<$FFFE>
Please answer me, Flaire!<$FFFE>
...I..feel the same way about you...<$FFFC>
No.<$FFFC>
I love you even more, with all my heart and my very soul.<$FFFE>
I'm so glad.<$FFFC>
...Heh, it's like you to say something like this.<$FFFE>
Huh!?<$FFFE>
After all, the spirit of rivalry is strong within you.<$FFFE>
Hey!<$FFFC>
You're so tactless!<$FFFE>
Sorry, Sorry!<$FFFC>
I just tried to cover up my own embarrassment somehow.<$FFFE>
...Your the only one for me.<$FFFC>
I've loved you ever since we've met for the first time<$FFFC>
when we were still kids.<$FFFE>
Yes, it felt like there was a red thread between you and me,<$FFFE>
tying us together for a lifetime.<$FFFE>
Flaire...<$FFFE>
So, when you were starting your training as a knight<$FFFE>
and we didn't see each other, I was so worried that we may never see each other again.<$FFFE>
...You can feel reassured.<$FFFC>
I won't leave you again.<$FFFC>
From now on I'll be by your side, always.<$FFFE>
...I love you...<$FFFE>
...I'm sorry.<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
At the moment, I'm not in the right mind for this.<$FFFE>
...<$FFFE>
With father's recent death and Velzeria controlling him all this time...<$FFFE>
...Forgive me, Flaire.<$FFFC>
I should have been more considerate of your feelings.<$FFFD>
Maybe once the decisive battle tomorrow is over, matters will be different.<$FFFD>
If you don't have those feelings right now, it's alright.<$FFFC>
I just acted too rashly.<$FFFE>
No, it's not your fault.<$FFFD>
It is just that my blood is boiling every time I think about what they did to father...<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
...I'm sorry.<$FFFE>
...Sealing Alhazard has to come before everything else.<$FFFC>
So that no wicked demons can be summoned anymore.<$FFFD>
Let us designate our efforts to revenge King Wilder and to put his soul to rest.<$FFFE>
...Will you help me with this?<$FFFC>
Absolutely.<$FFFE>
Yeah. I promise.<$FFFE>
Who is the man that's in your mind?<$FFFE>
Lewin<$FFFE>
Pierre<$FFFE>
Gilbert<$FFFE>
Fauvel<$FFFE>
Other<$FFFE>
L..Lewin...<$FFFE>
...I..!<$FFFD>
W..wha'ts troubling you,<$FFFC>
[diehardt's name]...?<$FFFE>
Up until now everything worked out fine.<$FFFE>
Yes.<$FFFC>
I think it's thanks to everyone trying hard.<$FFFE>
Noo, I haven't come to say this,<$FFFC>
I wanted to talk about you, Lewin.<$FFFE>
Eh!?<$FFFE>
You're still so very young...this fighting must be hard on you...<$FFFE>
That's why...<$FFFC>
I wanted to reward you...<$FFFE>
First of all I have to get rid of all those clothes!<$FFFE>
Don't you want to get ready too?<$FFFE>
S.stop this!<$FFFC>
Have you no shame!?<$FFFE>
There's no need to be shy...<$FFFC>
Come on in and get wet yourself...<$FFFE>
Ahh, it's hot...<$FFFD>
It's hot, [diehardt's name]...<$FFFE>
The secret is not to move much.<$FFFD>
This feels good.<$FFFE>
Ouch!<$FFFE>
I'm sorry, I was a bit too forceful.<$FFFC>
Hmm, its getting red already...<$FFFD>
Having a bath is the most relaxing thing...<$FFFE>
Scratching the back is fine if you don't do it too strong....<$FFFC>
Hey, that's not by back....<$FFFE>
And thus the evening went by...<$FFFE>
You're still awake, Pierre?<$FFFE>
Say, [diehardt's name].<$FFFC>
What do you think will happen to Elthlead after Altemüller has been defeated?<$FFFE>
Hmm?<$FFFC>
Let me see...<$FFFE>
You're worried about what'll to the truce with the Empire, now that Velzeria has been dealt with, right?<$FFFE>
Yeah, maybe...（Pause）<$FFFE>
I don't think the empire will try to invade us again. The former Kaiser died and they'll be busy rebuilding the country.<$FFFD>
We all should work together to keep the peace, no?<$FFFE>
....<$FFFC>
What's going on!?<$FFFC>
Why am I acting so serious all of a sudden!?）<$FFFE>
The reason for them to go to war was to improve the live of their people.<$FFFC>
We could've helped them by sending goods, then.<$FFFD>
Maybe, but they have their own pride too...<$FFFC>
I know there would have been a peaceful way, if they tried...<$FFFE>
Yes, Pierre...<$FFFE>
I hate this!<$FFFE>
Pierre!<$FFFE>
....<$FFFE>
Huh?<$FFFC>
Pierre....?<$FFFE>
*Sniff-sniff*...<$FFFC>
...Waaaa....<$FFFD>
Oh, [diehardt's name]?<$FFFC>
What're you doing being up so late?<$FFFD>
Huh?<$FFFC>
Why are you sitting on that chair?<$FFFD>
did something happen to your tent?<$FFFE>
....<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
Or are you always sleeping like this?<$FFFD>
Right now Pierre wants to be alone...<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
I was just a bit surprised.<$FFFE>
Gilbert?<$FFFD>
....<$FFFD>
...Well then!<$FFFC>
I guess you know what's at stake tomorrow?<$FFFD>
Yeah, I understand.<$FFFD>
That's good.<$FFFC>
...Some things can't be helped.<$FFFC>
Better get some sleep.<$FFFE>
....<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
....How did it went?<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
....*GRIN*!<$FFFE>
Good Evening.<$FFFE>
Oh, [diehardt's name].<$FFFC>
Where you going somewhere?<$FFFE>
No, I was just taking a walk to clear my mind a bit.<$FFFE>
I see.<$FFFC>
In that case, please come in and take a seat.<$FFFE>
I'm intruding.<$FFFE>
You aren't. Tomorrow is the decisive battle, it's the last chance to talk like this.<$FFFE>
I guess...<$FFFE>
....<$FFFC>
[diehardt's name], whose the one you have chosen?<$FFFE>
Eh!?<$FFFC>
What do you mean...?<$FFFE>
Don't play ignorant...<$FFFC>
You are surrounded by many beautiful girls your age, surely one has come to your attention?<$FFFE>
Fauvel, that's not......<$FFFE>
Maybe it's Tiaris?<$FFFC>
She's still immature but she'll be a beauty one day, no doubt!<$FFFD>
You'll have it tough with her, she's strong willed in a positive sense.<$FFFD>
Then maybe it's Riffany?<$FFFC>
She's such a kind girl and nothing short of gorgeous to boot.<$FFFD>
You'll have a hard time keeping others away from her though.<$FFFC>
That beauty mark would be driving any man insane....<$FFFE>
Um...Fauvel...<$FFFE>
Or maybe, it's Luna?<$FFFD>
The girl that's a genius tactician with a an air of ice around her.<$FFFC>
I can imagine the poor fellow that will be under her constant command some day.<$FFFE>
..In that case...<$FFFE>
It has to be Sophia who resides in your heart!<$FFFD>
Yes, she's such a good girl.<$FFFD>
Her devotion to Lushiris knows no boundaries and surely she'll be a wonderful wife someday too.<$FFFC>
She's my pride and joy...<$FFFE>
...I can't listen to this anymore...<$FFFC>
I gotta sneak my way out of this...<$FFFE>
Oh, and let's not forget about Lady Jessica.<$FFFD>
Yes, her beauty is almost out of this world...<$FFFD>
The goddess truly has blessed her in many ways.<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
With so many exquisite women around, I'm sure you have a hard time deciding...<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
Ah, to be young again...<$FFFD>
....<$FFFE>
Old people like to ramble and Fauvel continued like this the whole night...<$FFFE>
Then, who is it?<$FFFE>
Dios<$FFFE>
Silver Wolf<$FFFE>
Kirikaze<$FFFE>
Emaillink<$FFFE>
Jügler<$FFFE>
Ah...,<$FFFC>
Ah...,<$FFFE>
Hmm?<$FFFC>
What's the matter, [diehardt's name]?<$FFFE>
ANIKIII!<$FFFE>
Have you lost your mind!?<$FFFE>
It's not really pleasant being screamed at, you know...<$FFFE>
Just what are you doing!?<$FFFE>
I'm trying to figure out how to finish the secret secret of the Aniki!<$FFFE>
Hey! Wait a sec!<$FFFC>
Thanks for offering your assistance so willingly!<$FFFD>
Nooo!<$FFFE>
Dioooos!<$FFFE>
....<$FFFC>
Go...<$FFFE>
...<$FFFC>
...Aniki?<$FFFE>
That's music to my ears.<$FFFE>
Hey, Wolf!<$FFFD>
...Can you hear me?<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
It's no use. Time to get a bit louder.<$FFFE>
What a haul, what a haul!<$FFFE>
Wolf!<$FFFE>
Wow!<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
What're you doing here, [diehardt's name]?<$FFFC>
And so late at night at that...<$FFFE>
Tell me, why did you get so flustered right now?<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
And what's that sack you're carrying on your back for?<$FFFE>
Well...you see...<$FFFC>
...This...is...<$FFFE>
This is what?<$FFFE>
You're acting suspicious.<$FFFC>
Let me have a look!<$FFFE>
Wait..,you little!<$FFFE>
Those are gems right?<$FFFC>
And that sword...<$FFFC>
I get the feeling I've seen them before...<$FFFE>
Well..you see...that gem and this sword....<$FFFE>
Ah!<$FFFC>
That's the Ribbon Tiaris is always wearing!<$FFFE>
 <$FFFC>
You rotten thief!<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
Hey nor, I found those just lying around...<$FFFD>
I guess she dropped it on her way to her tent...<$FFFC>
I'll make sure she gets it back before tomorrow morning.<$FFFE>
Now I remember, that's Kirikaze's sword!<$FFFE>
Well, let's just say I borrowed it for a while!<$FFFC>
It's not stealing if you bring it back before anybody notices...<$FFFE>
And what are those things that look like clothes....<$FFFC>
Lingerie!?<$FFFE>
Eh!?<$FFFC>
Those are my real treasures...<$FFFC>
Here have a look at those.<$FFFD>
This looks like Rabbit Ears...<$FFFC>
A Leotard with a tail attached to it....<$FFFD>
And what's this?<$FFFC>
A Bunny Suit!?<$FFFE>
!!<$FFFE>
There's still more in there?<$FFFC>
Yes, there's still one thing left...<$FFFD>
However, I guess you could call this last one special...<$FFFE>
We have to be very careful...<$FFFC>
What I'm going to show you, diverts from the public view on moral...<$FFFE>
Ah, hey, [diehardt's name]...<$FFFE>
If we are spotted with it, we'll be in serious danger.<$FFFD>
Close the door and shut the windows and brace yourself...<$FFFE>
Mr. Nemon!<$FFFE>
Or, would you prefer being called Mr.Kyamon?<$FFFD>
....Hah!<$FFFE>
I get it, you're Mr. Shinmon then!<$FFFE>
That's not my name either!<$FFFC>
I'm Kirikaze!<$FFFE>
Huh, so what's the difference?<$FFFE>
It's different!<$FFFC>
It's absolutely different!<$FFFE>
No need to get so worked up about it.<$FFFC>
Just relax, take a breather.<$FFFE>
I tell you, it's completely different!<$FFFE>
............<$FFFE>
......<$FFFE>
...Chi!<$FFFE>
What's on your mind?<$FFFE>
I just wondered, Kirikaze.<$FFFC>
Is it true that you're eating rotten beans and raw fish where you come from?<$FFFE>
....<$FFFC>
I presume you are speaking about Tofu and Sashimi?<$FFFE>
Wouldn't eating something like this utterly destroy your stomach?<$FFFE>
Well no, of course it depends a bit on the cook.<$FFFC>
So, in the end it really is true, that you eat rotten things.<$FFFE>
Hmph...<$FFFC>
By the way, is it also true that all men are ninjas and all the women are Geishas where you come from?<$FFFE>
It's nothing like that!<$FFFE>
And everyone with a beard has to be called "Sensei"...<$FFFE>
What!?<$FFFC>
That's nonsense!<$FFFD>
Who would tell such ridiculous lies?<$FFFE>
Well, the folk at the Floating Castle...<$FFFD>
So, in reality it's different?<$FFFE>
Yes it's nothing like that at all!<$FFFE>
Dammit!<$FFFC>
What a letdown...<$FFFE>
...Sadly, it's typical for you westerners to misunderstand our culture in almost every way possible...<$FFFE>
What are you doing, Emaillink?<$FFFC>
I'm gazing at the moon...<$FFFE>
[diehardt's name]...<$FFFD>
I've been thinking about the battle that is awaiting us tomorrow...<$FFFE>
It's about having to do battle with Altemüller, right?<$FFFE>
Yes...<$FFFE>
After all, I cannot fight my beloved Excellency...<$FFFE>
I see...<$FFFE>
....<$FFFE>
....Huh?<$FFFD>
What was that just...now...<$FFFE>
So the truth comes out at last!<$FFFD>
Heh, are you really that surprised?<$FFFC>
Well...not really...<$FFFE>
But that's not the point!<$FFFC>
Have you fooled us the whole time!?<$FFFE>
Oh nononono.<$FFFE>
I'm actually drawn to powerful men like yourself!<$FFFE>
Yaaiii,<$FFFC>
Emaillink is a Man-lover!<$FFFE>
Shocking!<$FFFE>
So you've got something like a love-triangle with Varna?<$FFFD>
Sadly no, his Excellency is only interested in women...<$FFFE>
Come with me, I cried!<$FFFC>
I think it's time for me to be on my way, now!<$FFFE>
Only then did I find out that Varna had already captured his heart...<$FFFD>
Now, you wait...<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
I'm not...<$FFFB>

Or...<$FFFE>
Thus [diehardt's name]'s vision became one with the infinite dream.<$FFFE>
Jügler?<$FFFE>
Gurgur?<$FFFE>
To tell the truth I have a request...<$FFFE>
Gur?<$FFFE>
I can't resist it any longer! Have to touch!<$FFFE>
Kyuuuhh!<$FFFE>
Hmmmm!<$FFFC>
Soo Fluffy-Fluffy!<$FFFE>
Kyu,kyuu,kyuuu!<$FFFC>
（You soon are cuddling on the floor）<$FFFE>
This has to be a dream...<$FFFC>
I'm sleeping on some fluffy cotton-clouds...<$FFFD>
Good night, Jügler....<$FFFE>
Gurguruu..!<$FFFC>
（You feel something heavy laying on you!<$FFFC>
It's too hot, you can't breath!）<$FFFD>

（You fainted）<$FFFE>
<$FFFF>
