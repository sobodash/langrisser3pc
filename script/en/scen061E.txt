Lushiris Southern Gate<$FFFF>
Oh Gate...,<$FFFC>
may Lushiris sacred light fall upon you.<$FFFC>
To hold back the reawakened demonic forces, let your seal be renewed.<$FFFE>
It has been done.<$FFFE>
I suggest we go for the eastern gate next.<$FFFE>
The warden of the eastern gate is the sage Fauvel, I wonder if the Rig¸ler Empire will try something there.<$FFFE>
I'm sure father will be able to keep the gate safe.<$FFFE>
But we couldn't risk to let the Empire capture him, so please lend me your strength everyone.<$FFFE>
....<$FFFE>
What do you say?<$FFFE>
Let's go everyone!<$FFFE>
Anything else would be unjustifiable.<$FFFE>
You can count us in Sophia.<$FFFE>
We have to release the gate.<$FFFE>
Say nothing.<$FFFE>
Alright!<$FFFC>
Let's go everyone!<$FFFE>
I understand your worrying about your father.<$FFFC>
But don't let it get you down Sophia.<$FFFE>
Of course, thank you for your concern.<$FFFE>
We probably will have to face the Empire.<$FFFC>
This certainly will not be easy, so stay on your guard everyone.<$FFFD>
You too, Sophia.<$FFFE>
Yes, I shall do my best.<$FFFE>
We have to act quickly now,<$FFFC>
or we may be to late to reinstate the Gate...<$FFFE>
So this is the stone you got from the chief of the Shika tribe.<$FFFD>
Let's be extra careful with this...<$FFFC>
Åd<$fe><$1e>Åd<$fe><$1e>Åd<$fe><$1e>ÅdÅB<$FFFD>
We still don't know the exact method to use this.<$FFFC>
Yeah, I think it's kinda hopeless.<$FFFC>
Do you want to try to focus your mind as instructed?<$FFFD>

Altem¸ller's Private Chamber<$FFFF>
Your Excellency!<$FFFE>
Your injury has yet to heal entirely, your Excellency.<$FFFD>
Please be patient a little longer...<$FFFE>
Don't worry yourself.<$FFFD>
How could I stay lazily in bed while everyone is fighting out there?<$FFFE>
But I was ordered by General Varna to look after your health with utmost sincerity.<$FFFE>
Heh,<$FFFC>
that's much like Varna.<$FFFE>
Hasn't Lord Raymond has just been repelled and wouldn't this be the ideal time to strike back at Colcia?<$FFFE>
Yes sir,<$FFFC>
that is what they say.<$FFFE>
We cannot allow this opportunity to go to waste.<$FFFD>
If we grow idle, our enemies are guaranteed to get the better of us.<$FFFD>
Now make all due preparations for the attack!<$FFFE>
Yessir!<$FFFD>
Everything shall be done as you wish.<$FFFE>
<$FFFF>
