I'm sorry.<$FFFC>
After all the way we've come here....<$FFFE>
Don't worry about it.<FFFC>
It couldn't be helped.<$FFFE>
!?<$FFFD>
There are coming strange noises from the back of the village.<$FFFE>
H..help!<$FFFE>
It is terrible!<$FFFE>
What is the meaning of this!?<$FFFE>
It's awful!<$FFFC>
The dead from the graveyard have risen and are heading this way!<$FFFE>
Iyaa!<$FFFC>
What is this!?<$FFFE>
...It's, a zombie...?<$FFFE>
There are still other villagers back there!<$FFFC>
Huff*, someone has to warn them!<$FFFE>
Lewin, Tiaris we have to step in!<$FFFE>
Of course!<$FFFE>
W..what!?<$FFFC>
Me too!?<$FFFE>
Hehehe!<$FFFC>
Oh, there are more humans around, slay them all!<$FFFE>
Who's that oddball!?<$FFFC>
Is he the one that controls the zombies?<$FFFE>
It seems to be so.<$FFFC>
If we can take him out the zombies probably will cease their rampage too.<$FFFE>
I see.<$FFFC>
Anyway, we have no choice but to take up arms.<$FFFD>
Let's go Tiaris!<$FFFE>
Y..yes.<$FFFC>
I will give it my all!<$FFFE>
Abomination that dares to disturb the slumber of the deceased!<$FFFE>
You shall feel the wrath of my blade!<$FFFE>
Hehehe!<$FFFC>
Be my guest, you can come right over here and play with my little friends!<$FFFE>
[diehardt's name], I will do battle once more .<$FFFC>
I'm at your command!$FFFE>
Gilbert joined!<$FFFE>
Gilbert!<$FFFC>
...Alright, let's take care of those undead and their master!<$FFFE>
Hehehe!<$FFFD>
My unearthly powers cannot be bested!<$FFFE>
Damn you!<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
Let me refute that!<$FFFE>
Not bad!<$FFFC>
You struggle on well for being such worms!<$FFFD>
And before I could take on that sorcerers I needed some nice practice anyway!<$FFFE>
What Sorceress?<$FFFD>
...What are you talking about?<$FFFE>
Now, my wonderful servants! <$FFFC>
Show me the extend of your might! <$FFFE>
Huh?<$FFFE>
There's a grave over there too?<$FFFC>
Let's see if we have anything good here!<$FFFE>
Mihari Kushizekiki Hagujisoramu!<$FFFE>
!?<$FFFC>
C..coty.....<$FFFE>
.....<$FFFE>
Huhuhu!<$FFFC>
Kill all you want!<$FFFE>
Just who is this?<$FFFE>
He surely doesn't belong to the Rig체ler Empire or the Barral Kingdom.<$FFFE>
But no matter who he is, we cannot tolerate his evil ways.<$FFFE>
I have a bad feeling about this.<$FFFC>
Let's get this over with fast!<$FFFE>
On a grave in front of you, there is a potion.<$FFFE>
Do you want to take it?<$FFFE>
The potion stands upon a sheet of paper, which says:<$FFFC>
"Please take me with you."<$FFFE>
Take the potion with you?<$FFFE>
Nectar was obtained!<$FFFE>
As you turn to leave the potion gives of a disgusting scent of rotten skunk.<$FFFE>
There is a weird looking helm inside the hut.<$FFFE>
Do you take it?<$FFFE>
Egil Helm was obtained!<$FFFE>
There is a statue of the village's hero.<$FFFE>
What do you want to do?<$FFFE>
Offer up flowers<$FFFE>
Offer up 100P<$FFFE>
Offer up a prayer<$FFFE>
When you place the flowers on the stone socket, the spear the figure was holding falls right before your feet.<$FFFE>
Bloody Lance was obtained!<$FFFE>
Nothing happened...<$FFFE>
Nothing happened...<$FFFE>
Damn,<$FFFC>
if only I was stronger...<$FFFE>
What to say!<$FFFC>
What to do!<$FFFE>
Don't come near me!<$FFFE>
Don't come near me!<$FFFE>
I'm sorry.<$FFFC>
I can't fight anymore....<$FFFE>
Your blasphemic doings will no longer go unpunished!<$FFFE>
What are you babbling about?<$FFFC>
You're just being jealous because I've got so many exquisite comrades!<$FFFE>
No don't!<$FFFC>
Please stop, Coty!<$FFFE>
Jahahaha!<$FFFD>
Struggle all you want.<$FFFC>
There is nothing you can do.<$FFFE>
Damn....<$FFFE>
C..coty...<$FFFE>
[diehardt's name].<$FFFC>
Gilbert, you're pitiful!<$FFFE>
Stop this, it is me!<$FFFC>
Don't you recognize me Coty?<$FFFE>
.....<$FFFE>
D..daddy...<$FFFE>
Coty!<$FFFE>
!?<$FFFC>
This cheeky little thing dares to ignore my commands!<$FFFC>
Now that is something we cannot have! <$FFFE>
Kyaaaa!<$FFFE>
Farewell, Coty....<$FFFE>
Uuu...<$FFFE>
Somebody heelp!<$FFFE>
I'll be right there for you!<$FFFC>
Hold on!<$FFFE>
Everyone, make your escape to Gilbert's house!<$FFFC>
We will take care of them!<$FFFE>
Y..yes!<$FFFE>
Help...me...<$FFFE>
L..leave me be!<$FFFE>
Sir Gilbert!<$FFFE>
Someone help me!<$FFFE>
Rats, we have failed to protect the villagers!<$FFFC>
...If it wasn't so sad, it would be quiet a feat, being so patient.<$FFFE>
Iiiiiihh!<$FFFD>
Doing such to me, doing such a painful thing to me... <$FFFC>
You're lucky I have to take care of that sorceress...<$FFFC>
I shall remember this humiliation!<$FFFE>
It's over...<$FFFC>
But I'm concerned about how that lunatic managed to escape...<$FFFE>
<$F702><$F702>We gratefully accept your assistance, Sir Gilbert.<$FFFE>
Just Gilbert is fine.<$FFFE>
Just Gilbert is fine.<$FFFE>
There is also need to thank you properly.<$FFFC>
Due to your help everyone in the village was saved.<$FFFD>
As a token of our gratitude you shall have the village's secret treasure.<$FFFE>
Divine Blessing was obtained!<$FFFE>
It is said that, if it is used by a courageous person it will grant mysterious powers.<$FFFE>
Thank you, everyone.<$FFFE>
Use it well for the sake of the restoration of the Larcuss Kingdom.<$FFFD>
We are rooting for you.<$FFFC>
Please keep at it!<$FFFE>
<$F703><$F703>Halt!<$FFFC>
Don't you dare hurt my daughter!<$FFFE>
Sir Gilbert...<$FFFE>
Coty, please stop this!<$FFFD>
If you must direct your hate at someone,<$FFFC>
it should be me!<$FFFE>
Fool!<$FFFC>
Why did it have to come to this...<$FFFE>
...Daddy...<$FFFE>
You all have my thanks.<$FFFC>
You have saved me...<$FFFD>
Please take care of daddy for me.<$FFFE>

I've got everything under control, you humans cannot hope to even scratch the likes of me.<$FFFD>
Now I'm your opponent and you shall die at my very own hands!<$FFFC>
Hihihihi!<$FFFE>
Those measly humans are doing quiet well.<$FFFD>
Let's see how they like this!<$FFFE>
Kyaaa!<$FFFC>
Even more have appeared!<$FFFE>
In such numbers they could be getting troublesome.<$FFFC>
I wonder if there is a way to make short work of them...<$FFFE>
Undead creatures are vulnerable to holy powers.<$FFFC>
If you take your companions affinity's into consideration, you can do battle much more effectively.<$FFFE>
[diehardt's name], even more enemies have shown up!<$FFFE>
Oh come on, I've had enough of this!<$FFFE>
Do their numbers know no end!?<$FFFE>
Hihihi!<$FFFD>
There are many more that'd like to have fun with you, I can assure you!<$FFFE>
Khe, still more are coming!<$FFFE>
Ohh, giving up already?<$FFFC>
Hihihi!<$FFFE>
No longer will I permit you to disturb the slumber of the dead!<$FFFC>
This I swear by Lushiris holy name!<$FFFE>
Abomination!<$FFFC>
You will pay for what you did to Coty!<$FFFE>
Hihihi!<$FFFC>
I was quiet surprised myself to find out that you were this poor girl's father.<$FFFD>
But truly, you should be thanking me!<$FFFC>
After all, it was made possible solely by my hand that you could meet your beloved daughter again!<$FFFE>
Grr! I'll cut you to pieces for spouting such mockeries!<$FFFE>
Coty!<$FFFE>
....Please, daddy...<$FFFE>
Please help those people.<$FFFC>
Right now your strength is needed.<$FFFE>
But only because I lived by the sword you were killed.<$FFFE>
All that happened just because of my thoughtlessness...<$FFFE>
At this moment there are many people that suffer.<$FFFC>
And the sorrow in this world is yet to grow further.<$FFFE>
I'm not sad any more because I know that you love me always.<$FFFC>
My one wish is that no one has to suffer any longer...<$FFFE>
....I understand.<$FFFC>
I lost my way, but your kindness showed me what I must to do.<$FFFC>
Thank you.<$FFFE>
Daddy....<$FFFE>
Please watch over me, Coty.<$FFFD>
From now on I will wield my sword for the sake of people's happiness.<$FFFC>
And one day we will restore peace throughout all of Larcuss, so make sure to watch closely.<$FFFE>
Sir [diehardt's name].<$FFFC>
My path lies clearly before me.<$FFFD>
For the sake of the people of Larcuss, I will take up a sword once more.<$FFFC>
If I may, I will follow your lead from here on out.<$FFFE>
<$FFFF>
