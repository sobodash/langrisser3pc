Scenario - 15<$FFFC>
"The Haja no Ken"<$FFFE>
Dios, who has deserted from the Barral Army, has<$FFFC>
joined the party as they hurry towards the ruins of<$FFFC>
Estool, where that blade from a foreign country,<$FFFC>
the Haja no Ken, now sleeps.<$FFFE>
As so many causes coalesce into one,<$FFFC>
history is certain to be made......<$FFFE>
*Condition for Victory<$FFFC>
 -Complete annihilation of enemies<$FFFC>
*Conditions for Defeat<$FFFC>
 -Death of [diehardt's name]<$FFFC>
 -Loss of the Haja no Ken<$FFFE>
Rig・er Castle - Paul's Personal Quarters<$FFFF>
Hohoho!<$FFFC>
So that ever-victorious, undefeated Altem・ler is hard-pressed in battle, eh!<$FFFC>
My heart pounds in ecstasy!<$FFFE>
Paul, Your Eminence.<$FFFC>
It is most gratifying indeed.<$FFFE>
Just icing on the cake.<$FFFC>
His present activities merely confirm that he is on the wane.<$FFFE>
With his father's death, my father finally became first in line to inheritor the power and privilege of the Emperorship.<$FFFE>
Furthermore, since I am Father's child, it will be difficult for Altem・ler to claim the succession over me!<$FFFE>
Since he so rarely blunders, though, he always gets on my nerves.<$FFFE>
It's been said that General Gaiel also holds little love for that damned brat.<$FFFE>
....What do you think?<$FFFE>
Hmm....that's an interesting bit of information.<$FFFC>
I wonder if we can use him.<$FFFE>
One way or another, winning this war for the Empire will be the last thing that fool Altem・ler ever does!<$FFFE>
<$FFFF>
