Scenario - 18<$FFFC>
"Ultimate Military Device of Antiquity"<$FFFE>
After [diehardt's name] and company defeated Flaire and reclaimed<$FFFC>
Laffel, they soon found themselves faced with the problem posed<$FFFC>
by the cruel slaughter of the main troops.<$FFFE>
Without a doubt, they now had to defeat the Empire's magically<$FFFC>
propelled giant soldier and rescue Lord Raymond.<$FFFE>
*Condition for Victory
 -Defeat both General Bortz and the<$FFFC>
 magically-propelled giant soldier, Galshook<$FFFC>
*Condition for Defeat<$FFFC>
 -Death of [diehardt's name]<$FFFE>
Field of Battle Near Larcussia Castle<$FFFF>
U..ugh.......<$FFFE>
How's Lord Raymond's condition?<$FFFE>
Your Excellency Altem・ler, you can see here.<$FFFD>
The Lord yet clings to life.<$FFFC>
However, it would be dangerous to move him right now.<$FFFE>
You're just as I've heard, Lord Raymond.<$FFFC>
When you've recovered from your wound, we'll take you to the Empire.<$FFFD>
Of course, you won't come as a guest, but rather as a prisoner.<$FFFE>
U...gh.....<$FFFE>
Your Excellency!<$FFFD>
It looks like Laffel, previously occupied by Barral, has been captured by Larcuss forces.<$FFFE>
...The independent forces commanded by that [diehardt's name] fellow, eh.<$FFFD>
They'll probably head here and try to rescue Lord Raymond.<$FFFD>
Send someone to Bortz.<$FFFC>
Tell him to use the magically-propelled giant soldier to end the threat of this force.<$FFFE>
Yes, sir!<$FFFE>
It's getting to be time for me to return as well.<$FFFC>
Bring word to our main headquarters as soon as Lord Raymond's condition stabilizes.<$FFFE>
As you wish.<$FFFE>
Larcussia Defense Perimeter - Imperial Front-Line Base<$FFFF>
General Bortz!<$FFFC>
We've received orders from His Excellency Altem・ler.<$FFFE>
Great, what do they say?<$FFFE>
We are to intercept and destroy the surviving rebel army which is headed here, using the Galshook.<$FFFE>
There's a remaining military force headed here!?<$FFFD>
Very well.<$FFFC>
Tell him I shall accept this mission.<$FFFE>
Yes, sir!<$FFFE>
If possible, I'd rather not use the Galshook.....<$FFFD>
But if they were able to retake Laffel, I might not have that luxury.<$FFFE>
<$FFFF>
