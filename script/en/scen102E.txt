Scenario ~ 31<$FFFC>
"Threads between People"<$FFFE>
The Dark Knight shows his true face,<$FFFC>
being the familiar one of the thought-dead Geriord.<$FFFC>
When finding out about it, [diehardt's name]'s heart<$FFFC>
becomes enshrouded in sadness.<$FFFE>
Furthermore, the malicious influence of Velzeria could still be felt<$FFFC>
in the air surrounding Geriord.<$FFFC>
Could this all be Velzeria's doing?<$FFFC>
And is this the source of<$FFFC>
King Wilder's insanity as well?<$FFFE>
To uncover the truth the division<$FFFC>
makes its way to the<$FFFC>
Kingdom of Barral.<$FFFE>

You're getting lax Emaillink.<$FFFC>
Look closely how it is done.<$FFFE>
Hmph, after all their just numbers.<$FFFE>
However, it saddens me to think that we fight our own kind.<$FFFE>
What nonsense.<$FFFC>
Those who dare resist me have no place in the new Empire.<$FFFC>
They are only good for dulling my blade.<$FFFE>
