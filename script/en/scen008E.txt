If we pass through here it won't be far to the southern Lushiris Gate.<$FFFE>
Please wait!<$FFFC>
There are troops stationed in this town!<$FFFE>
Those are!?<$FFFE>
Barral troops...<$FFFE>
What of it!<$FFFE>
If we can't get through here, we can't make it to the southern gate so let's just force our way through!<$FFFE>
Hmm!?<$FFFC>
Princess, the enemy has appeared!<$FFFE>
Are they remnants of the Larcussian army?<$FFFE>
We got word that Lord Raymond has gathered troops around him, maybe they belong to him?<$FFFE>
Perhaps...<$FFFC>
It seems as if they are planning to pass through the Raylim Mountains.<$FFFE>
This must mean that they plan to conduct further operations inside our country.<$FFFC>
Make all due preparations to intercept them!<$FFFE>
That women seems to be the enemy's commander.<$FFFE>
It couldn't be...Princess Flaire!?<$FFFE>
We don't have spare time for a detour.<$FFFE>
A battle is inevitable.<$FFFE>
....<$FFFE>
Hey, [diehardt's name]!<$FFFC>
Stop just standing there looking silly!<$FFFE>
Y..Yeah...<$FFFE>
2nd division here, the southwest gate has been secured.<$FFFE>
1st division reporting in, the western gate has been secured.<$FFFE>
3rd division here, the northwest gate has been secured.<$FFFE>
Archers, advance!<$FFFD>
Support the frontline!<$FFFE>
Yessir!<$FFFE>
The enemy has made it into the city...<$FFFD>
All troops commence an all out attack!<$FFFC>
Exterminate the intruders!<$FFFE>
Flaire...<$FFFE>
All my guards have been defeated...<$FFFD>
No matter how grim it looks, I will fight to my last breath!<$FFFE>
Sir [diehardt's name].<$FFFC>
The enemy employs Archers.<$FFFD>
Please pay attention.<$FFFE>
They're dangerous because they can strike from a distance, without giving the chance to retaliate.<$FFFD>
Furthermore they are most effective against flying units.<$FFFE>
I see you are in the know.<$FFFC>
Provided that you can close in on them and force them into melee, even flying units can take them out with ease.<$FFFE>
I see.<$FFFD>
So the best way would be to stay out of range and close in on them in one fell swoop.<$FFFE>
Correct.<$FFFE>
Move out!<$FFFC>
Don't give them a chance to make up ground.<$FFFE>
To ensure the prosperity of the Barral Kingdom, we have to deal with those remnants of Larcuss.<$FFFC>
Eveyone, I rely on you!<$FFFE>
...There's no doubt about it.<$FFFC>
It really is Flaire!<$FFFE>
What is the matter, [diehardt's name]?<$FFFE>
If my eyes aren't playing a trick on me the enemy commander is Princess Flaire.<$FFFE>
Eeehh!?<$FFFC>
You mean she is your childhood friend, [diehardt's name]?<$FFFE>
Princess Flaire!<$FFFE>
Who is calling me!?<$FFFE>
It's me, Diehärte!<$FFFC>
You couldn't have forgotten about me, right?<$FFFE>
Diehärte...?<$FFFC>
...I know no one who goes by that name!<$FFFE>
Flaire!?<$FFFE>
When it comes to the enemy I have no such thing as a memory!<$FFFD>
My sole mission is to defeat you.<$FFFC>
It's unfortunate, but if you insist on attacking, you will have to die!<$FFFE>
Set up blockades at the entrances of the town!<$FFFE>
As you wish!<$FFFE>
Infantry corps, advance!<$FFFE>
Well then, what would be the best way to take the city...?<$FFFE>
Sir [diehardt's name].<$FFFC>
Instead of trying to break through all the gates, we should concentrate our efforts on one of them.<$FFFE>
What's your opinion on the matter?<$FFFE>
There's no need for that<$FFFE>
My plan exactly<$FFFE>
You're right<$FFFE>
There's no need for that.<$FFFC>
We should be able breaking all the gates.<$FFFE>
Surely it would be possible for us to do so, but we would suffer unnecessary damage that way.<$FFFC>
Please consider my advice and concentrate our forces.<$FFFE>
I'll think about it.<$FFFE>
Don't worry.<$FFFC>
That's what I was planning as well.<$FFFE>
In that case excuse me<$FFFC>
for imposing with my unneeded commentary.<$FFFE>
There's no need for an apology.<$FFFC>
Your opinion is much cared about, so please continue to always speak your mind openly.<$FFFE>
I..I will..<$FFFE>
...You're right.<$FFFC>
It would be unprofitable to divide our troops to attack all gates at once.<$FFFE>
Yes.<$FFFE>
Flaire, it is me, Diehärte!<$FFFE>
...It has been a long time, Diehärte.<$FFFE>
So, have you become a knight by now?<$FFFE>
Yeah.<$FFFE>
Yeah.<$FFFC>
It seems like you are doing honor to your familie's name, [diehardt's name].<$FFFE>
I see.<$FFFC>
In that case, let me offer my congratulations.<$FFFE>
I never would have thought it possible to meet you under such circumstances...<$FFFE>
Why did Barral...why did King Wilder tore apart the alliance and started an invasion on Larcuss!?<$FFFE>
Half a year back, I met King Wilder in the City of Laffel but there was nothing left of the once kind King I knew!<$FFFE>
Humans change with the flow of time.<$FFFE>
But you haven't changed Flaire, have you!?<$FFFE>
I have no desire to fight you...<$FFFE>
You're just going easy on me for being a woman!<$FFFE>
As matters now stand, we are mutual enemies.<$FFFC>
I won't hold back anything!<$FFFE>
Upon getting close to the waterfall, the hilt of a swords comes into sight.<$FFFE>
Do you want to pull it out?<$FFFE>
The Lawnmower was obtained!<$FFFE>
The sword flows away to the inner waterways...<$FFFE>
Uuwwaa!!<$FFFE>
I'm sorry, [diehardt's name].<$FFFC>
Please carry battle on in my stead...<$FFFE>
Iaaa!<$FFFE>
Khe!<$FFFE>
Ow!<$FFFE>
It hurts...<$FFFE>
My, you will have to go on without me...<$FFFE>
Forgive me, Sir[diehardt's name].<$FFFC>
Retreat seems most advisable!<$FFFE>
Aaaahh!<$FFFC>
...I.Impossible...<$FFFE>
Sir [diehardt's name], you commanded us magnificently.<$FFFE>
Sir [diehardt's name]...<$FFFC>
We took way too long fighting...<$FFFD>
This will have negative effects on the next battle...<$FFFE>
I hate to have to do this,[diehardt's name]!<$FFFC>
Tell me, why did it have to come to this...?<$FFFE>
I don't know.<$FFFC>
I really don't know, Flaire.<$FFFD>
The only thing I do know is that if it wasn't for Barral's invasion,<$FFFC>
there would be no reason for us to fight each other like this!<$FFFE>
I'm the princess of Barral!<$FFFC>
If the King decides to invade Larcuss I have no choice but to follow,<$FFFD>
even if it makes us enemies...<$FFFC>
We cannot go back to those merry days.<$FFFC>
Now there is nothing left to do but to fight!<$FFFE>
Flaire...<$FFFC>
I wanted to avoid hurting you, but it seems that it cannot be helped.<$FFFD>
Please prepare yourself.<$FFFE>
Spare me the pitiful look.<$FFFC>
Come at me with all your might!<$FFFE>
Guuaarg!<$FFFE>
Arrggg!<$FFFE>
Ahhh!<$FFFE>
Uuu!<$FFFE>
I've got to protect...the princess...<$FFFD>
Guuaa!<$FFFE>
Guuu!<$FFFE>
Farewell, Princess...<$FFFE>
You shall not pass!<$FFFC>
The gate must hold...<$FFFE>
I couldn't protect...<$FFFE>
Run...fools...<$FFFD>
Guaa!<$FFFE>
Curse you!<$FFFE>
I won't lose to the likes of you!<$FFFE>
Fuuu!<$FFFE>
How careless of me...<$FFFE>
Forgive me, Princess...<$FFFE>
Never would  I have expected...<$FFFE>
No way!?<$FFFE>
Uwaaa!<$FFFE>
I thought we would win...<$FFFE>
That's not true...<$FFFE>
Urg...<$FFFE>
Damn!<$FFFC>
So many things left undone...<$FFFE>
P..Princess...<$FFFE>
G.Guuuarg!<$FFFE>
Both the Archers and the infantry have been crushed!?<$FFFD>
The remnants of Larcuss wield great power...<$FFFE>
The troops that defended the gates are no more...<$FFFC>
Now it's up to the Infantry and Archers to hold them off...<$FFFE>
The Archers have been routed too...<$FFFE>
Both the Archers and the infantry have been crushed!?<$FFFE>
Survivors of Larcuss!<$FFFC>
Turn back now or suffer the consequences!<$FFFE>
You won't pass through this gate!<$FFFE>
Not over my dead...body...<$FFFE>
Never will you make it...<$FFFD>
You won't lay as much as finger on the princess!<$FFFE>
You had your chance to run!<$FFFC>
Now, prepare to breath your last breath!<$FFFE>
I must take full responsibility for all the soldiers that died today!<$FFFE>
The enemy has made their move, prepare countermeasures!<$FFFE>
Be careful out there!<$FFFE>
Yessir!<$FFFE>
<$FFFF>
