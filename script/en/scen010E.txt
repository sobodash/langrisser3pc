-Death of [diehardt's name]<$FFFE>
Forest of the Shika Tribe<$FFFF>
From here on out move forward with great care.<$FFFC>
We are now entering the Shika Tribe's territory.<$FFFE>
Hmm?<$FFFC>
I saw something moving right over there!<$FFFE>
Shikaaa!<$FFFE>
Iaaaaa!<$FFFE>
I'm worried about Sophia's well-being.<$FFFC>
We should finish this battle quickly.<$FFFE>
I've got to say, fighting without any kind of magic is quiet the pain in the pants...<$FFFE>
Hmph, it seems like you are having a hard time.<$FFFE>
You're, Emaillink?<$FFFE>
So that fog is suppressing the use of magic.<$FFFC>
Well that's certainly unfavorable for the both of us.<$FFFE>
First of all I'll strike down that shaman.<$FFFE>
This is our hunting ground.<$FFFC>
Entering we don't permit!<$FFFE>
Shikashika!<$FFFC>
Kill them!<$FFFE>
Lord [diehardt's name].<$FFFC>
As expected we must force our way through once again.<$FFFE>
It seems to be so.<$FFFE>
With fog, Kah Shind becomes invincible!<$FFFC>
I not be defeated, by anyone!<$FFFE>
If that's the case you surely won't mind me trying!<$FFFE>
Everyone, keep your guard up.<$FFFC>
We are dealing with a crafty magic user of the Shika tribe.<$FFFE>
A Shaman borrows powers of the spirits to cast magic.<$FFFC>
It is a fundamentally different form of magic than the one I use.<$FFFE>
In other words those guys will be able to cast magic even in this mist?<$FFFE>
Most certainly, after all the mist is a product of the spirits itself.<$FFFE>
Shoot!<$FFFC>
That's so unfair!<$FFFE>
Go! Go!<$FFFC>
Push down enemy!<$FFFE>
Shikaaa!<$FFFE>
God of Shika.<$FFFC>
Grant us power to fight, Arekashi!<$FFFE>
Me Kah Shind greatest Shaman!<$FFFC>
I defeat all enemies alone!<$FFFE>
You come across a stone circle dedicated to the Shika deity.<$FFFD>
In the center the land bears a strange mark.<$FFFE>
Do you want to excavate at this spot?<$FFFE>
You discovered a black and a white box.<$FFFE>
What do you do?<$FFFE>
Open the white box<$FFFE>
Open the black box<$FFFE>
Open both simultaneously<$FFFE>
Amulet was obtained<$FFFE>
When the white box was opened, the black box was shut tight...<$FFFE>
Vestments of Darkness were obtained!<$FFFE>
When the white box was opened, the black box was shut tight...<$FFFE>
None of the boxes could be opened no matter how hard you try..<$FFFE>
After a short while the boxes disappear without a trace..<$FFFE>
Foolish!?<$FFFC>
You will only earn pain with such an attitude...<$FFFE>
Now, make the fog disappear!<$FFFE>
Super shock!<$FFFE>
Dammit!<$FFFE>
My swordplay must have set on rust...<$FFFE>
UUwaaa!<$FFFC>
It hurts....!<$FFFE>
Oh my?<$FFFC>
My vision is growing dark...<$FFFE>
Forgive me...<$FFFE>
Shi, Shikaaa!<$FFFE>
The fog has cleared up.<$FFFC>
Now we can do battle unhindered!<$FFFC>
Let the affaire d'honneur commence, [diehardt's name]!<$FFFE>
It would be my pleasure!<$FFFE>
The fog has cleared up.<$FFFD>
After those pests are dealt with,<$FFFC>
we shall conclude our affaire d'honneur, [diehardt's name]！<$FFFE>
Sure thing!<$FFFE>
Feel god's anger!<$FFFE>
Shika!<$FFFE>
Shi..Kaaa..<$FFFE>
Shishikaa!<$FFFE>
Shi....<$FFFE>
Shika...<$FFFE>
Shikashika!<$FFFE>
Shi..ka...<$FFFE>
Shikashika!<$FFFE>
Shikaaa!<$FFFC>
You enemy!<$FFFC>
Kah Shind is greatest tactician!<$FFFC>
Not be defeated no matter what!<$FFFE>
Sealing magic was not a bad plan, but doing so with fog was quiet absurd.<$FFFD>
A true tactician would have thought about all consequences of such an action.<$FFFC>
After all it was only thanks to your fog, that I could encircle you like this!<$FFFE>
Shshishikaaa!<$FFFE>
You think you have what it takes to be an opponent worthy of my blade?<$FFFE>
We will not know that if we don't try!<$FFFE>
In that case come at me with everything you got!<$FFFE>
I praise you for making it so far with the body of a woman.<$FFFC>
However under such circumstances I can make no exception.<$FFFC>
I beg your forgiveness!<$FFFE>
If you're such a softy you should simply surrender!<$FFFE>
I praise you for making it so far with the body of a woman.<$FFFC>
However under such circumstances I can make no exception.<$FFFC>
Thus I beg you're forgiveness!<$FFFE>
On the battlefield it is irrelevant weather you are man or woman!<$FFFE>
I praise you for making it so far with the body of a woman.<$FFFC>
However under such circumstances I can make no exception.<$FFFC>
I beg you're forgiveness!<$FFFE>
Have it your way!<$FFFC>
But I warn you not to go easy on me!<$FFFE>
I wonder how much strength the Remnants of Larcuss can muster.<$FFFC>
Let me show to you just how much!<$FFFE>
You did quite well!<$FFFC>
But this is not the kind of injury that'll make me run from an unfinished battle!<$FFFE>
We will carry on the fight from here on out.<$FFFC>
Please step back General!<$FFFE>
But...<$FFFE>
Fighting on would be unreasonable and you may even loose your life.<$FFFC>
Please withdraw for now!<$FFFE>
Thank you, everyone...<$FFFE>
You did quiet well...<$FFFC>
I wouldn't have believed it possible to be utterly defeated like this.<$FFFD>
The next time we meet I will use all my power to strike you down.<$FFFC>
Farewell!<$FFFE>
We've come so far...<$FFFE>
Take this!<$FFFE>
Uuu...!<$FFFE>
Wh..Whaaat!?<$FFFE>
No, my spear...<$FFFE>
I have been bested...<$FFFE>
Guugugu...<$FFFC>
And so...I go down...<$FFFE>
Have at you!<$FFFE>
I welcome death...<$FFFE>
Gaargh!<$FFFE>
Dear blood, please enter my body again...<$FFFE>
How dare you...<$FFFE>
Now that all those nuisances have been dealt with,<$FFFC>
we can do battle unhindered!<$FFFC>
Let the affaire d'honneur divulge who is the greater man, [diehardt's name]!<$FFFE>
It would be my pleasure!<$FFFE>
So this is where you are, [diehardt's name].<$FFFC>
I've been searching you!<$FFFE>
Emaillink!<$FFFE>
May the affaire d'honneur commence, [diehardt's name]!<$FFFE>
It's over at last!<$FFFE>
You did commendable, Sir [diehardt's name].<$FFFE>
Sir [diehardt's name]...<$FFFC>
You are a source of disappointment for me...<$FFFD>
Being so slow surely will have negative effects on the next battle...<$FFFE>
Unexpectedly we lost some time.<$FFFC>
That general Emaillink is only one of the four imperial generals.<$FFFC>
And yet he alone is an opponent not to be taken lightly...<$FFFE>
To think that there are three others of the like.<$FFFC>
I wonder if we would be able to win if we have to face them one day.<$FFFE>
What do you reply?<$FFFE>
I guess we could?<$FFFE>
If we hold together<$FFFE>
We would defeat them with ease<$FFFE>
I'm not sure.<$FFFC>
I guess we could win?<$FFFE>
So you are worried too then.<$FFFE>
I wonder.<$FFFC>
Yet, we couldn't be defeated by anything if we hold together!<$FFFE>
Well, isn't that right.<$FFFE>
We'll be fine, it'll be an easy victory against them!<$FFFE>
Rejoice, the mighty [diehardt's name] is on our side!<$FFFE>
We have to hurry.<$FFFC>
Sophia's life is still in danger.<$FFFE>
Alright, Let's be on our way to the Shika Tribe headquarters!<$FFFE>
ShikaShika...<$FFFC>
Great mother of many souls, hear your son praying.<$FFFD>
Come forth fog, seal harmful power of evil people.<$FFFC>
Shikashika Areyashina Shi Desutsu!<$FFFE>
!?<$FFFC>
What's with that fog, coming up all of a sudden!?<$FFFE>
Oh my?<$FFFC>
Something odd is happening, Sir [diehardt's name].<$FFFE>
What's the matter, Riffany?<$FFFE>
For some reason I can no longer use my magic.<$FFFE>
It's quiet peculiar.<$FFFC>
Before we came here I'm sure it worked just fine.<$FFFE>
Same here.<$FFFC>
It's like all my magical energy was drained when this fog came up.<$FFFE>
AAaa!<$FFFE>
What is the matter Tiaris?<$FFFE>
It's awful,[diehardt's name]!<$FFFC>
I can no longer use my magic!<$FFFE>
This fog being the holy fog.<$FFFC>
Evil Power is sealed!<$FFFC>
Shikaa!<$FFFE>
The fog has cleared up.<$FFFD>
Now, strike down all remaining enemies!<$FFFC>
Everyone, press onward!<$FFFE>
What!?<$FFFC>
How could that be happening just out of the blue?<$FFFE>
Maybe this fog...?<$FFFC>
Luna, any ideas...?<$FFFE>
It is quiet possible that this fog is not a natural phenomenon but was summoned to seal magical powers...<$FFFE>
So this fog has influence on the use of magic?<$FFFE>
...That's troublesome, our strategy relies to a fair extend on the use of magic.<$FFFE>
Shikaaa!<$FFFE>
What?<$FFFC>
They have prepared an ambush for us!?<$FFFE>
Foolish you are!<$FFFC>
Me is Kah Shind Greatest Shaman!<$FFFD>
Go!<$FFFC>
Everyone, you kill!<$FFFE>
Shikaaaa!<$FFFE>
