So this is how it will be.<$FFFC>
Do you think you can take me on?<$FFFD>
Or was it all just big talk?<$FFFE>
Keh!<$FFFE>
What is going on here?<$FFFC>
Altemüller and Emaillink are fighting each other!?<$FFFE>
So you came,[diehardt's name].<$FFFC>
I'll send you all to oblivion along with Emaillink.<$FFFE>
Please wait, Master Böser.<$FFFC>
My plans for Barral seems to have failed.<$FFFD>
Please allow me to restore myself here.<$FFFE>
...Hmm.<$FFFC>
Very well.<$FFFD>
Rag.<$FFFC>
I leave this matter in your hands.<$FFFC>
Don't let any of them escape!<$FFFD>
I will await good news in the castle.<$FFFE>
Yes my Lord!<$FFFE>
W..wait!<$FFFE>
Grr, he made his escape.<$FFFE>
Emaillink!<$FFFC>
What on earth is happening here?<$FFFD>
Aren't you one of the Rigüler Generals?<$FFFE>
Right now I'm nothing of the like.<$FFFC>
My sword now is aimed at Altemüller, it is nothing short of a rebellion.<$FFFE>
A rebellion?<$FFFE>
That sword Al Hazard...it changed his excellency.<$FFFE>
As of now his excellency is not the person I look up to.<$FFFE>
He must be possessed by Al Hazard already.<$FFFE>
So even a man like him can't resist the transformation Al Hazard induces.<$FFFE>
Undoubtedly the cursed sword took advantage of his rampant anger.<$FFFD>
In this state he's no longer the same person.<$FFFE>
That explains.<$FFFC>
But right now we have to concentrate on rescuing the citizens and rid the world of the abomination called Rag!<$FFFE>
Oh yeah, he's exactly right!<$FFFE>
I will do my best to hinder the demons from entering the city!<$FFFE>
Just don't die on us, Emaillink.<$FFFE>
Ha, I cannot possibly loose with this many monsters.<$FFFC>
And to put the cherry on the cake, voilà!<$FFFD>
Come forth my little pests!<$FFFE>
Ah yes, this should suffice.<$FFFC>
Prepare yourselves to suffer!<$FFFE>
Why are the imperial troops protecting us?<$FFFE>
First of all I'm human.<$FFFC>
That's why I will not stand by and let the demons do as they please.<$FFFE>
I enjoy human company so much.<$FFFD>
Here to show my affection I have a little present for you.<$FFFC>
Be thankful and die happily!<$FFFE>
What!?<$FFFC>
Even more demons?<$FFFE>
You will pollute Laffel no longer with your presence, demon scum!<$FFFE>
Unfortunately they outnumber us greatly<$fe><$28><$FFFC>
...Will we be able to hold them back?<$FFFE>
Everyone, escape this way!<$FFFE>
Y..yes!<$FFFE>
It's noisy outside town...<$FFFC>
Did even more demons appear?<$FFFE>
Wait a sec, that's Layla over there.<$FFFC>
We have to save her no matter what!<$FFFE>
Please hold out, Layla!<$FFFC>
Help is on the way!<$FFFE>
Lady Layla be patient just a little longer!<$FFFC>
You can rest assured that help will arrive shortly!<$FFFE>
Layla, hold out!<$FFFC>
Help is already here!<$FFFE>
GAAA!<$FFFE>
Damn!<$FFFC>
They entered the town!<$FFFE>
They are right behind us!<$FFFC>
Everyone, run!<$FFFE>
Hurry up and chase after the citizens...<$FFFE>
...Run.<$FFFE>
Stop targeting the townsfolk!<$FFFC>
What reason could you possibly have for this!?<$FFFE>
Hehehe...<$FFFC>
It is just too enjoyable to watch their lives being sniffed out.<$FFFD>
Their screams are the sweetest music to my ears.<$FFFE>
Monster!<$FFFE>
You won't toy with the lives of others any longer!<$FFFE>
So what, are you telling me that what you do is any better?<$FFFC>
Do you not use your companions to further your ends and hurt people that are important to others?<$FFFE>
That may be so but I would never toy with the lives of others like you do!<$FFFC>
What we are doing is just!<$FFFE>
You still don't understand?<$FFFC>
Good and bad are relative things but you'll have plenty of time to think about this once I send you to the netherworld.<$FFFD>
For me true happiness can only be achieved by supreme domination of the demon kind.<$FFFE>
That will never come to be!<$FFFE>
You come across a stone that seems to be moving on its own.<$FFFE>
What do you do?<$FFFE>
Lift it up<$FFFE>
Watch it<$FFFE>
Step on it<$FFFE>
You found a small fairy that was stuck under the rock.<$FFFD>
"Thank you kindly.<$FFFC>
I was taking a nap when suddenly that rock collapsed right on my.<$FFFD>
Your kind heart shall be rewarded."<$FFFD>
As the fairy spoke those words, it flew off on the winds and something sparkling fell to the ground.<$FFFE>
Do you want to pick it up?<$FFFE>
You suddenly hold a beautiful spear in your hands.<$FFFE>
Gea Bolg was obtained!<$FFFE>
After a while the rock stopped moving....<$FFFE>
When you step on the rock it stopped moving.....<$FFFE>
You come across a gigantic formation of rocks. As you approach it a roll of thunder can be heard.<$FFFC>
Upon taking a closer look, you can see that the rock looks like a man's face.<$FFFD>
That very moment the stony eyelids raise and the mouth opens to speak.<$FFFC>
"I will grant you my providence, if you know my name."<$FFFE>
How do you call him?<$FFFE>
Freya<$FFFE>
Thor<$FFFE>
Loki<$FFFE>
The giant went silent and disappeared.<$FFFE>
"You have spoken well, now receive your reward.<$FFFD>
What would proof most useful to you?"<$FFFE>
Choose one of the following<$FFFE>
Megingjöro<$FFFE>
Mjöllnir<$FFFE>
Strength<$FFFE>
"If that is your wish.<$FFFC>
You shall have my belt Megingjöro."<$FFFE>
Megingjöro was Obtained!<$FFFE>
"If that is your wish.<$FFFC>
You shall have my hammer Mjöllnir."<$FFFE>
Mjöllnir was obtained!<$FFFE>
"If that is your wish.<$FFFC>
You shall be granted power."<$FFFE>
<$f6>Blessing<$fc>Strength rises +2<$FFFE>
Tall seemed satisfied and disappeared while laughing thunderously.<$FFFE>
The giant went silent and disappeared.<$FFFE>
I promised to Geriord.<$FFFC>
I promised to come back and liberate Laffel!<$FFFE>
All of this was your doing!<$FFFE>
Yes, most certainly!<$FFFC>
Will you ever understand?<$FFFC>
Your humans are nothing but tools to be used by us superior demons!<$FFFE>
Shut up and die, you monster!!<$FFFE>
What did you do to Altemüller?<$FFFE>
Nothing really, he simply was chosen by Alhazard.<$FFFD>
Anger, Hate and all negative feelings is what Alhazard is feasting upon.<$FFFD>
Alhazard chose him because of the strength of those emotions within him.<$FFFC>
He will be a splendid Böser!<$FFFE>
Silence!<$FFFE>
Forgive me...Geriord...Layla...<$FFFD>
I can't fight....anymore...<$FFFE>
Hiyahiyahiyahiyahiya!<$FFFC>
After all you're nothing but weak, pathetic and utterly worthless humans!<$FFFE>
...I'm so sorry Layla...<$FFFC>
If only I'd been a little bit stronger...<$FFFE>
How dare you oppose us!<$FFFE>
Ah...Argh!<$FFFC>
My power didn't suffice...<$FFFE>
Ouch...<$FFFC>
That hurts...<$FFFE>
Useless...<$FFFC>
This is just the beginning...<$FFFE>
You demons will never rule our world!<$FFFD>
Be gone, monstrosities!<$FFFE>
Guugh!<$FFFC>
We cannot be defeated like this...<$FFFE>
The Demons have become strong...<$FFFE>
By Lushiris's holy light!<$FFFE>
Don't let the demons win...<$FFFE>
I will not waste my mercy for you demons!<$FFFE>
Such strong negative impulses....<$FFFE>
Grrrr....<$FFFC>
....noooo....<$FFFE>
It was Velzeria which orchestrated King Wilder's downfall!<$FFFC>
For this you'll pay dearly!<$FFFE>
Return to the world of darkness!<$FFFE>
Dammit!<$FFFC>
This is all I'm capable off.<$FFFE>
Please Diehärte.<$FFFC>
Protect Laffel!<$FFFE>
Until Laffel knows peace again, I can't lay down to die!<$FFFE>
The demon's goal is to take over our world.<$FFFC>
By Lushiris holy name we will not allow those demons to succeed!<$FFFE>
Aaah...<$FFFC>
The clear blue moon...<$FFFE>
In memory of the ones that fell before you, it is my duty to cleanse this world of you demon kind.<$FFFD>
Prepare yourself!<$FFFE>
Ugghh!<$FFFC>
What a foolish mistake!<$FFFE>
If it wasn't for you, father would....<$FFFD>
This is for revenging my father!<$FFFE>
I won't let you do as you please with this world!<$FFFE>
S..Still...<$FFFC>
I...can....<$FFFE>
You make angry,<$FFFC>
feel supreme Shikafury!<$FFFC>
Do Kahni won't let you get away!<$FFFE>
Sh..Shi..kaa...<$FFFE>
I'm sorry, [diehardt's name].<$FFFC>
No more...<$FFFE>
I will not allow you to lay so much as a finger on the citizens!<$FFFE>
I didn't have what it takes...<$FFFE>
I hope the next world will be better...<$FFFE>
Goodbye, cruel world....<$FFFE>
Feel my wrath!<$FFFE>
Now we will repay you for everything you have done so far!<$FFFE>
I'm afraid that killing me won't do you any good.<$FFFC>
The reign of darkness is inevitable!<$FFFD>
Your in for some serious punishment.<$FFFE>
With pleasure I will dye my hands with the colour of your blood!<$FFFC>
Innocent people were murdered!<$FFFD>
Today you will pay for all your crimes against humanity!<$FFFE>
Ugh....<$FFFE>
Ha!<$FFFC>
Die!<$FFFC>
The way things turned out...<$FFFE>
I'm sorry...I have become an obstacle..to you...<$FFFE>
..Dark..Knight...<$FFFE>
Kyaaah!<$FFFE>
L..Layla!<$FFFE>
Layla!<$FFFE>
...I wanted...to see...Geriord...just...one more time...<$FFFE>
Forgive me...Geriord...<$FFFC>
.........<$FFFE>
Iyaaah!<$FFFE>
Those cursed demons....<$FFFE>
Everyone...<$FFFE>
I won't have it!<$FFFC>
I don't wanna die...<$FFFE>
This is not the time.<$FFFC>
I'm still too immature...<$FFFE>
Death is calling for you...<$FFFC>
Or would you prefer being my puppet?<$FFFE>
This is how my way ends...<$FFFE>
The Dark Knight, that's impossible!?<$FFFC>
What folly is this!?<$FFFC>
At this point he shouldn't be able to maintain sane!<$FFFE>
...I wonder what happened to...the worm I placed in King Wilder...<$FFFE>
W..What did you just say?<$FFFE>
So it was you who manipulated King Wilder all along!?<$FFFE>
Haha!<$FFFC>
But of course!<$FFFE>
When the king was searching for his daughter and fell from the cliff I took the chance to attach one of my little darlings right to his split head!<$FFFE>
...You did all of this to my father!<$FFFE>
This is unforgivable!<$FFFC>
This is intolerable!<$FFFE>
I will not permit you to play with human lives any longer!<$FFFE>
Now now, that's hardly something to get upset over.<$FFFC>
How ungrateful you are, after all I did to preserve your father!<$FFFD>
Well then...my pet...<$FFFC>
My body....<$FFFE>
Now worm, come to...my body...<$FFFE>
<$F702><$F702>Wh..Why..would my bewitchment won't work..?<$FFFE>
Ha! That sword!?<$FFFC>
It blocks of my magic...<$FFFE>
The Langrisser seals away the evil powers of the demon tribe.<$FFFC>
Your magic is no exception to that.<$FFFE>
Langrisser seals away the evil powers of the demon tribe.<$FFFC>
Your magic is no exception to that.<$FFFE>
Langrisser seals away the evil powers of the demon tribe.<$FFFC>
Your magic is no exception to that.<$FFFE>
My body is falling apart...?<$FFFC>
Save..me...Böser...<$FFFE>
Iiiaahhh!<$FFFE>
It's over.<$FFFE>
He won't be able resurrect this time.<$FFFE>
Um..<$fe><$28>.<$fe><$28>.<$fe><$1e><$FFFC>
Thank you very much for saving us.<$FFFE>
Please take this as a symbol of our eternal gratitude.<$FFFE>
Divine Blessing was obtained!<$FFFE>
...Father.<$FFFC>
Your tormentor is no more.<$FFFC>
Please rest in peace now.<$FFFE>
...Father.<$FFFC>
Your tormentor is no more.<$FFFC>
Please rest in peace now.<$FFFE>
Flaire...<$FFFE>
Thank you, [diehardt's name].<$FFFE>
Thank you, [diehardt's name].<$FFFE>
Do you hear me, Flaire!?<$FFFC>
The culprit for King Wilder's madness is dead.<$FFFD>
...still, if it wasn't for him Flaire and Wilder wouldn't have...<$FFFE>
Still, as long as Al Hazard roams freely there will be no peace.<$FFFE>
Still, as long as Al Hazard roams freely there will be no peace.<$FFFE>
That's true.<$FFFD>
Say, Emaillink.<$FFFC>
What are you planning to do now that you have detached from Altemuller?<$FFFE>
<$F703><$F704><$F705><$F703><$F704><$F705>Such veracity...<$FFFE>
What noble thing to say, word's like this surely aren't spoken casually.<$FFFE>
*Sniff* I understand this kind of sorrow.<$FFFE>
...Alright.<$FFFC>
Let us go together then.<$FFFE>
We are Altemüller's last hope.<$FFFE>
Emaillink joins the party!<$FFFE>
General!<$FFFC>
Please take this as a token of our gratitude!<$FFFE>
Talisman was obtained!<$FFFE>
<$F706><$F706>I just hope that Altemüller isn't beyond help already.<$FFFE>
<$F707><$F707>Well then, move out!<$FFFE>
Bastard!<$FFFC>
You lowly humans should just accept death in silence!<$FFFD>
But it matters not to me, this town is mine anyway.<$FFFE>
We will see about that!<$FFFE>
ZAPP....<$FFFE>
ZAPP....<$FFFE>
GOOON...<$FFFE>
GOOON...<$FFFE>
Master Rag...will make me...immortal...<$FFFE>
For eternal darkness...<$FFFE>
ZAPP....<$FFFE>
GYAAA!<$FFFE>
GYAAA!<$FFFE>
GASHAN!<$FFFE>
GASHAN!<$FFFE>
GASHAN!<$FFFE>
ZAPP....<$FFFE>
ZAPP....<$FFFE>
GYAAA!<$FFFE>
GYAAA!<$FFFE>
GASHAN!<$FFFE>
ZAPP....<$FFFE>
KYSHAAA!<$FFFE>
GYAAA!<$FFFE>
GUGYAAA!<$FFFE>
GUGYAAA!<$FFFE>
W..whaat!<$FFFC>
All my minions have been annihilated!?<$FFFE>
The Dark Knight!?<$FFFC>
...the Barral army is here!?<$FFFE>
There is no need to be afraid, the Barral Kingdom has collapsed!<$FFFC>
He currently is our ally!<$FFFE>
The Dark Knight!?<$FFFC>
What kind of prank is that!?<$FFFC>
With my worm possessing him he shouldn't be able to be sane!<$FFFE>
....I wonder what happened to the worm I placed inside Barral's King....just what is going on?<$FFFE>
Wh..What did you just utter?!<$FFFE>
It was you who controlled King Wilder!?<$FFFE>
Haha!<$FFFC>
But of course.<$FFFE>
When the king was searching for his daughter and fell from the cliff, I took the chance to attach one of my little darlings right to his split head!<$FFFE>
...You did all of this to my father!<$FFFE>
This is unforgivable!<$FFFC>
Your evil ways end here!<$FFFE>
I will not permit you to play with human lives any longer!<$FFFE>
In stead of Princess Flaire, I will deliver you to justice!<$FFFE>
Try your worst!<$FFFC>
You'll soon realize how helpless you humans are before me!<$FFFE>
Damn this!<$FFFC>
There are still more of them!?<$FFFC>
Hurry up, Sir Diehärte!<$FFFE>
Of course!<$FFFC>
It's already!<$FFFE>
Almost nothing of his former Excellency Altemüller is left.<$FFFC>
His heart is becoming more like one of a demon by the day.<$FFFE>
At this point it is pains me to even look at him.<$FFFC>
That's why I will put an end to his misery with my own hands.<$FFFE>
Doing so, while still a fragment of his heart remains, is proof of my unwavering loyalty to him.<$FFFE>
It is futile.<$FFFC>
The power of the worm will not safe you this time.<$FFFE>
Certainly.<$FFFE>
Understood.<$FFFC>
Leave it to me.<$FFFE>
