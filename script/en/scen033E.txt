Defeat Wilder<$FFFE>
Death of [diehardt's name]<$FFFE>
Barral Royal Castle<$FFFF>
Your majesty.<$FFFC>
The Elthlead troops has breached our borders.<$FFFE>
What happened to Flaire?<$FFFE>
Concerning that matter.<$FFFC>
Seemingly she has allied with the Elthlead troops.<<$FFFE>
What?<$FFFC>
Flaire has betrayed me?<$FFFE>
I'm afraid it seems that way...<$FFFE>
They surely will come here directly.<$FFFC>
Neglect all other duties, defending the castle takes top priority for all available troops!<$FFFE>
In order to stop the Elthlead invasion she lost her life on the battlefield....<$FFFE>
...So she is dead.<$FFFC>
Well, I didn't expect much to begin with.<$FFFD>
But I cannot believe that the Dark Knight has fallen.<$FFFE>
With both the Dark Knight and the princess dead<$FFFD>
Elthlead can march right to our doorstep.<$FFFE>
Understood.<$FFFC>
Neglect all other duties defending the castle takes top priority for all available troops!<$FFFE>
Yessir!<$FFFE>
So this is Barral Castle.<$FFFE>
Yeah this is it.<$FFFE>
What a skilfully crafted structure.<$FFFC>
There is no way to invade this castle from above.<$FFFE>
Remember, if King Wilder sees reason we shouldn't prolong this battle unnecessarily.<$FFFE>
It has been a long time since you've been here...<$FFFE>
I would never have imagined returning here in such manner.<$FFFE>
It feels like it was just yesterday that we played here as kids.<$FFFE>
....<$FFFE>
King Wilder is bound to be inside.<$FFFE>
To uncover the truth, we should make our way to him as soon as possible.。<$FFFE>
Easier said than done; are we just going to force our way through?<$FFFC>
Attacking this fortress will prove to be quiet the challenge.<$FFFE>
Besides King Wilder can't change for the worse any further.<$FFFE>
That's right.<$FFFC>
He's already one bloodthirsty guy as of now.<$FFFD>
But seriously you know that we could be killed here right?<$FFFC>
Our chances to make it through straight on are rather slim.<$FFFE>
However, just standing turning tail is not really an option.<$FFFE>
If we allow Velzeria to do as they please,<$FFFC>
Barral soon will end like my country.<$FFFE>
There seems to be no other way than to use force.<$FFFD>
After coming this far already, we have to see it through to the end.<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
Everyone move out!<$FFFE>
You worthless idiots have permitted the enemy to advance this far!?<$FFFD>
Archmages destroy the bridges leading to the towers, this should slow down the enemy considerately.<$FFFC>
After that shower the enemy with your spells!<$FFFE>
Yessir!<$FFFE>
This party is the elite unit of the Elthlead troops.<$FFFC>
As soon as this bunch is dealt with we will be the strongest indisputably,<$FFFD>
nothing on the continent will rival the might of the Barral Kingdom!<$FFFE>
But, the princess...<$FFFE>
She has turned traitor.<$FFFC>
As such she is no longer the princess but a common criminal.<$FFFC>
Kill her along with the others!<$FFFE>
B..but...<$FFFE>
What is it?<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
Are you in conspiracy with the enemy too?<$FFFC>
Hmm?<$FFFE>
...At your command.<$FFFE>
King Wilder....<$FFFE>
Crap!<$FFFC>
It hurts just to look at him but can we even be sure that this is not his true self after all?<$FFFE>
What do you say?<$FFFE>
It maybe is.<$FFFE>
There got to be a different reason.<$FFFE>
Maybe we are too late already.<$FFFE>
Is this the king's true character?<$FFFE>
Yeah, who would know for sure.<$FFFE>
Hey now, grumbling won't solve anything.<$FFFC>
Let's just do what we came to do !<$FFFE>
Hey now grumbling won't solve anything.<$FFFC>
Let's just do what we came to do !<$FFFE>
No, I don't think so.<$FFFC>
There's bound to be a good reason for this.<$FFFD>
And don't we stand here right now because we want to find out what the real cause is?<$FFFE>
Heh, that's right...<$FFFD>
We have to get the King back to sanity, even if it takes some old fashioned hitting on the head!<$FFFE>
Thank you...,<$FFFC>
everyone...<$FFFE>
Maybe we are already too late.<$FFFE>
No!<$FFFC>
One should not expect the worst!<$FFFD>
We have to find a way to bring back the kind King!<$FFFE>
Damn straight!<$FFFC>
That's exactly what we'll do!<$FFFE>
Thank you...,<$FFFC>
everyone.<$FFFE>
Could this be the king's true character?<$FFFE>
Hm?<$FFFC>
Did you say something?<$FFFE>
N..no.<$FFFC>
It's nothing.<$FFFE>
....<$FFFE>
Those murderers of princess Flaire must be delivered to justice!<$FFFE>
Yessir!<$FFFC>
Please leave!<$FFFC>
Attack! Revenge the princess!<$FFFE>
Crap!<$FFFC>
It hurts just to look at him but can we even be sure that this is not his true self after all?<$FFFE>
The bridges have been destroyed...<$FFFE>
Now it will be difficult to defeat the enemy Archmages.<$FFFD>
But, with them at our flank charging in is dangerous.<$FFFE>
Flying and Sea units should take care of this. <$FFFC>
Now it's getting serious.<$FFFD>
We must get close to King Wilder to determine if there is a relation to Velzeria.<$FFFE>
That is the only way.<$FFFE>
Yessir!<$FFFE>
Right now we should look out for things relating King Wilder with Velzeria.<$FFFE>
Right now we should look out for things relating King Wilder with Velzeria.<$FFFE>
Right now we should look out for things relating King Wilder with Velzeria.<$FFFE>
I wonder if there's any.<$FFFC>
Here we go everyone!<$FFFE>
King Wilder.<$FFFC>
The end of this battle draws near.<$FFFC>
Stop your wasteful resistance...<$FFFE>
Hehehe!<$FFFC>
I've got to admit you are an opponent worthy of my praise.<$FFFD>
But you haven't got what it takes to bring down me!<$FFFC>
Unconditionally you will fall before me...<<$FFFE>
Father, why...<$FFFE>
Why!?<$FFFE>
Nothing less than Immortality.<$FFFC>
But don't concern yourself with that, you all shall die right now!<$FFFC>
Hehehe!<$FFFE>
Seems like he really lost it...<$FFFC>
I've got a bad feeling about this.<$FFFE>
I wonder what the enemy is hoping to achieve...<$FFFE>
We can only speculate...<$FFFC>
What are they up to...?<$FFFE>
...You won't be the ones laughing last...<$FFFC>
King Wilder...<$FFFE>
Cavalry move out to the western gate!<$FFFE>
Yessir!<$FFFE>
Cavalry protect the eastern gate!<$FFFE>
Understood!<$FFFE>
So you have returned home, Flaire.<$FFFD>
You should fight by my side.<$FFFC>
Or do you wish for a swift end along with your new comrades?<$FFFE>
Father, please stop already.<$FFFE>
You dare giving me advice!?<$FFFD>
I'm growing tired of you and your recalcitrant ways!<$FFFD>
You are no longer my daughter!<$FFFC>
Kill them all!<$FFFE>
[diehardt's name]I have a request.<<$FFFC>
Please help my father!<$FFFE>
You have my word for it!<$FFFE>
King Wilder.<$FFFC>
You are being controlled.<$FFFC>
And we are here to release you from this malicious influence!<$FFFE>
Controlled you say?<$FFFC>
What rubbish.<$FFFE>
I was born to rule, not to obey orders by someone else!<$FFFE>
<$F702><$F702>King Wilder..<$FFFE>
You are the ones that murdered my daughter.<$FFFC>
You have caused me pain unmeasurable!<$FFFE>
It seems useless...<$FFFC>
He's a totally different person.<$FFFD>
Where is the kind Wilder I know?<$FFFE>
...I don't get it<$FFFC>
What kind of bewitchment could disfigure him so.<$FFFD>
There seems to be only one method left to try...<$FFFE>
...But is fighting truly the only way?<$FFFE>
Father ready yourself!<$FFFE>
Oh.<$FFFC>
You point a sword at your father who raised you and gave you life!<$FFFD>
It saddens me to see what my own daughter has come to.<$FFFC>
The one that has gone mad is no other than you Flaire!<$FFFE>
Ever since you changed, the people of Barral suffered from poverty and starvation.<$FFFD>
Even if it means to bear the stigma of striking down ones own father,<$FFFD>
for the well-being of my future subjects, I will not show mercy to you!<$FFFE>
Upon stepping on a magical symbol on the floor, a brilliant light shines down on you.<$FFFC>
The strange light points to the western direction.<$FFFD>
Out if nowhere a beautiful women appears before your eyes.<$FFFC>
The woman carries a sparkling coin.<$FFFD>
"You who are guided by the goddess of light,<$FFFC>
which of the following do you crave more,<$FFFD>
is it the power of the sword or the power of magic?"<$<$FFFE>
What do you reply?<$FFFE>
Power of the Sword<$FFFE>
Magic power<$FFFE>
Despise both<$FFFE>
"It seems you have no need for my gifts."<$FFFC>
The woman vanished...<$FFFE>
"If that is so, receive my gift."<$FFFE>
Star Coin was obtained!<$FFFE>

"If that is so, you shall receive my gift."<$FFFE>
Excalibur was obtained!<$FFFE>
"It seems you have no need for my gifts."<$FFFC>
The woman vanished...<$FFFE>
We have no time to lose!<$FFFC>
Snap out of it!<$FFFE>
Come back to your senses, Wilder!<$FFFC>
Be the kind man you once were!<$FFFE>
Sanity and Insanity, what are those?<$FFFD>
Who are you to judge another one sane or insane!?<$FFFC>
This baseless accusation is nothing short of heresy!<$FFFE>
Wilder...<$FFFC>
Now...<$FFFE>
This battle will decide who is sane and who is insane.<$FFFC>
Come now and taste the power of my true self!!<$FFFE>
Urrghh..<$FFFC>
I'm sorry, Flaire..<$FFFE>
It hurts!<$FFFC>
There's always hope.<$FFFE>
I won't be defeated!<$FFFC>
You have not what it takes to best me!<$FFFE>
Maybe this is exactly what Velzeria planned...<$FFFE>
You must carry on!<$FFFC>
..Guaagh!<$FFFE>
Uwaaah!<$FFFC>
It is too strong!<$FFFE>
Are you prepared for what's to come?<$FFFE>
It's useless.<$FFFC>
My current power....<$FFFE>
I'm still incomplete....<$FFFE>
Please open your eyes!<$FFFE>
Diehärte, please do something to save him!<$FFFE>
Ouch...that's rude...<$FFFE>
Grrrr....<$FFFE>
How did it come to this?<$FFFC>
So much fun!<$FFFC>
Bite me!<$FFFE>
...King Wilder...<$FFFD>
What a strange thing to meet you in battle, no?<$FFFE>
To think that you would turn traitor Dios.<$FFFC>
Have you forgotten everything I've done for you?<$FFFE>
Have you forgotten what you owe this country?<$FFFC>
I'm here because I remember that clearly.<$FFFD>
What a strange thing to meet you in battle, no?<$FFFE>
People change their minds every single day, it's only natural.<$FFFC>
This isn't any different, is it not?<$FFFD>
It is different because you are no longer human.<$FFFC>
...Die Dios!<$FFFE>
Tch!<$FFFE>
Dam..mit....<$FFFC>
King Wilder...<$FFFE>
I'm sorry Diehärte...<$FFFC>
I thought being accustomed to the castle would give us an advantage..<$FFFE>
We are facing off against Barral's elite troops.<$FFFC>
This is going to be a tough fight....<$FFFE>
But we cannot let ourselves being defeated here.<$FFFC>
Not after all the was we came.<$FFFE>
The leader of a nation must always think of his people first or his county is doomed.<$FFFE>
But my only concern are my people.<$FFFC>
For instance I will put the fertile lands of Elthlead to good use for them!<$FFFE>
Uuh!<$FFFC>
Dammit you won't get away with this!<$FFFE>
Feel my anger!<$FFFC>
Insolent rabble!<$FFFE>
Father!<$FFFC>
Please return to sanity!<$FFFD>
Otherwise you leave me no choice...<$FFFE>
Hoho...<$FFFC>
You think you could kill me?<$FFFE>
F..Father..<$FFFE>
Why do you have to cause me so much grieve.<$FFFC>
When you were lost in the woods I didn't abandon you and this is how you repay me?<$FFFE>
...It's useless...<$FFFC>
I won't be swayed...<$FFFE>
That's right we have to fight Flaire!<$FFFC>
If we don't stop him nobody will!<$FFFE>
...<$FFFE>
F..Father why...<$FFFE>
Argh...<$FFFC>
How did it come to this...<$FFFE>
I'm sorry Flaire.<$FFFC>
To make you fight your own father like this.<$FFFD>
I should have been more careful with my commanding...<$FFFE>
For Shika Tribe!<$FFFC>
Do Kahni is hero!<$FFFC>
I'm stronger!<$FFFE>
You Villain!<$FFFC>
Do Kahni no longer permits evil ways!<$FFFC>
I make you pulp!<$FFFE>
Shiikaa!<$FFFC>
Do Kahni didn't expect...such force...<$FFFE>
Don't even try to trick Flaire!<$FFFC>
This force shall be your reward!<$FFFE>
Could you kill Flaire?<$FFFC>
This force shall be your reward!<$FFFE>
Creepy freak....<$FFFD>
Hahahah!<$FFFC>
Your execution will be carried out right now.<$FFFE>
Desertion calls for capital punishment!<$FFFC>
Does it not Dios?<$FFFE>
What...How....<$FFFC>
Am I..really going to die..like this...<$FFFC>
F..Flaire...<$FFFE>
Wilder...<$FFFE>
Father!<$FFFE>
Oh, Flaire...<$FFFC>
You are safe.<$FFFE>
I lost sight of you while you where chasing after your prey.<$FFFE>
...Fa..ther?<$FFFE>
You mustn't go to the inner part of the forest alone.<$FFFE>
But it is safe if I come along...<$FFFE>
It seems his memories are in disorder.<$FFFE>
Where am I....<$FFFE>
Last thing I know is I was searching for Flaire...<$FFFC>
..The horse run wild...and I fell of the cliff..<$FFFE>
Are your memories returning to you?<$FFFE>
My body...changed...<$FFFC>
And Flaire..<$FFFE>
Wilder you've got to hang in there!<$FFFE>
..Who is it..what...doing...uuarghh!<$FFFE>
What's wrong Wilder!?<$FFFE>
Uaargh!<$FFFE>
Eeeaahhh!<$FFFC>
Faather!<$FFFE>
You idiot!<$FFFE>
He..he cut off his own head...<$FFFE>
He..he cut off his own head...<$FFFE>
...It seems I'm too late.<$FFFE>
The Dark Knight?!<$FFFE>
!<$FFFC>
Geriord!?<$FFFE>
What the hell, shouldn't he be kinda dead right now?<$FFFE>
Yes, I did verify his death cautiously.<$FFFC>
His heart had already stopped...<$FFFE>
I'm immortal.<$FFFC>
No common method can put my life to its end.<$FFFE>
What are we supposed to do?<$FFFC>
Now that we know that you are Geriord I would prefer not to fight you...<$FFFE>
Say Geriord.<$FFFC>
I don't understand any of this.<$FFFE>
Did you just forget who we are?<$FFFC>
Answer me!<$FFFE>
Oh I remember you perfectly.<$FFFE>
You are the people that deserted Laffel when the Barral Kingdom attacked.<$FFFC>
...How could I forget.<$FFFE>
But that's!<$FFFE>
...Tell me then, you didn't forget what you promised Layla, right!?<$FFFE>
..Layla..?<$FFFE>
So you do remember Geriord!<$FFFE>
Layla still waits for you to return to her!<$FFFE>
Lay..la...Uaargh!<$FFFC>
Argh, my head...<$FFFE>
Geriord!<$FFFE>
*Huff*...The velzerian worm is in my head.<$FFFC>
He locked away my consciousness and took control over my body.<$FFFE>
Even when my heart stopped the power of the worm revived me.<$FFFC>
The only way to release me is to cut my head off!<$FFFE>
You have to be quick about it!<$FFFE>
Then, my father's sudden change...<$FFFE>
Then, Wilder's change...<$FFFE>
Was the result of the infection with the worm as well.<$FFFC>
The worm can only enter your body if you are close to death.<$FFFD>
Once he's inside you, all wounds heal miraculously but the heart is taken over completely.<$FFFD>
That's why you must kill me while I'm still myself!<$FFFE>
Dammit!<$FFFC>
Is there no other way?<$FFFE>
...There is another way...<$FFFE>
...There is another way...<$FFFE>
Jessica!?<$FFFE>
I know a magic that can expel the worm.<$FFFC>
However...<$FFFE>
I know a magic that can expel the worm.<$FFFC>
However...<$FFFE>
However?<$FFFE>
With the worm gone the life extending effects will also fade away.<$FFFC>
If the worm is removed the person most likely only has some days left to live.<$FFFE>
With the worm gone the life extending effects will also fade away.<$FFFC>
If the worm is removed the person most likely only has some days left to live.<$FFFE>
You mean his life ends no matter what we do?<$FFFE>
You mean his life ends no matter what we do?<$FFFE>
I cannot last much longer...<$FFFC>
Hurry, you must cut my head off!<$FFFE>
Emergency!<$FFFC>
Corps of the demon tribe are attacking Laffel...!<$FFFD>
Right now lady Layla organizes the evacuation of the citizens, but...<$FFFE>
Layla!?<$FFFE>
In any case, please hurry!<$FFFE>
Damn!<$FFFC>
At such a time!<$FFFE>
...Great Sorceress.<$FFFC>
Please help me with your magic.<$FFFE>
Are you certain about this?<$FFFE>
Once the worm is gone your body will begin to fall apart.<$FFFC>
During this time you will have to endure great suffering.<$FFFE>
To escape this torment you probably will desire death over all before long.<$FFFE>

During this time you will have to endure great suffering.<$FFFE>
To escape this torment you probably will desire death over all before long.<$FFFE>
I don't care.<$FFFC>
...I cannot die just yet.<$FFFC>
My only purpose left in life is to protect Layla.<$FFFE>
If it is to ensure Layla's safety I will endure any measure of pain!<$FFFE>
...Geriord.<$FFFE>
...I understand.<$FFFC>
I will prepare the cleansing.<$FFFE>
...I understand.<$FFFC>
I will prepare the cleansing.<$FFFE>
You will not get passed me!<$FFFE>
You..will not...<$FFFE>
Stand down!<$FFFC>
Sooo painful!<$FFFE>
Don't move....!<$FFFE>
Why did you...<$FFFE>
Ahhh, I'm too rich to die....<$FFFE>
Well....<$FFFE>
My magic wasn't...<$FFFE>
Godess...<$FFFE>
As the flesh is torn the soul grows free....<$FFFE>
I need a stronger spell...<$FFFE>
It is hopeless!<$FFFE>
Uarrghh!<$FFFE>
What is...power...<$FFFE>
I..I couldn't win...<$FFFE>
Blasted!<$FFFE>
You asked for it!<$FFFE>
Be gone, cretins!<$FFFE>
Now or never...<$FFFE>
You have to...<$FFFE>
For the Barral Kingdom!<$FFFE>
I still can go on....guargh!<$FFFE>
Need more strength....<$FFFE>
Why...here....<$FFFE>
So cruel...<$FFFE>
How can we be defeated....<$FFFE>
King Wilder please escape...<$FFFE>
How unreasonable...<$FFFE>
Aahh..it's too late...<$FFFC>
Unless you kill me right here!<$FFFE>
You won't go any further!<$FFFE>
Gyaaaahhh!<$FFFE>
Guargh!<$FFFE>
Uugh...<$FFFC>
No wonder they could drive away even the Empire...<$FFFE>
I welcome death...<$FFFC>
I..can't leave my child..behind...<$FFFE>
Do you really came to bring King Wilder back to sanity?<$FFFD>
All our efforts have been vain...<$FFFE>
If there's any chance to save him,<$FFFC>
we will take it.<$FFFE>
Father, please stop already!<$FFFE>
Father you're currently not yourself.<$FFFC>
Please hurry and return back to your true self!<$FFFE>
What are you babbling about.<$FFFC>
This and no other is my true form.<$FFFE>
...Father.<$FFFE>
...What should we do now?<$FFFE>
...Cut him down.<$FFFE>
...Cut him down.<$FFFE>
Flaire?<$FFFE>
I can no longer bear to look at my father in this state.<$FFFE>
I can no longer bear to look at my father in this state.<$FFFE>
....<$FFFE>
What do you say?<$FFFE>
I understand.<$FFFE>
...Are you really alright with this?<$FFFE>
I can't do it.<$FFFE>
I understand.<$FFFC>
There is no other way to stop him.<$FFFE>
At least, try to not make him suffer...<$FFFE>
At least, try to not make him suffer...<$FFFE>
...Of course.<$FFFE>
...Are you really alright with this?<$FFFE>
<$F703><$F703>...I understand.<$FFFE>
...I can't do it.<$FFFC>
...It seems like all our efforts are in vain.<$FFFC>
How could I kill the gentle king Wilder...<$FFFE>
[diehardt's name] you coward!<$FFFC>
In that case I'll do it myself!<$FFFE>
[diehardt's name] you coward!<$FFFC>
If you can't do it I will.<$FFFC>
But,...oh..<$FFFE>
No, this is more than you should bear.<$FFFC>
...Stand back, Flaire.<$FFFC>
I will do it.<$FFFE>
It is the only we can do for him.<$FFFC>
And because of that,<$FFFC>
...I feel no regret....<$FFFE>
Father...<$FFFC>
After all we couldn't find a way to restore the kindness to your heart.<$FFFE>
<$FFFF>
