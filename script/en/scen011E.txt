We have to concentrate all our forces on the chief!<$FFFD>
That is the only possible way to save lady Sophia!<$FFFE>
Kyaaaaaa!<$FFFE>
H..How could we let this happen?<$FFFC>
We weren't there for her in time...<$FFFE>
You there!<$FFFC>
Do me the favor and massacre this lot!<$FFFE>
Kaa!<$FFFE>
Well then, let us enjoy ourselves, shall we!?<$FFFE>
Miss Sophia.<$FFFC>
Please leave the fighting to us and watch from safety.<$FFFE>
I have to refuse, Sir [diehardt's name].<$FFFC>
While the Velzerian Demons roam freely, I can not stand idly by.<$FFFD>
Thus I will go to battle together with you.<$FFFE>
Very well.<$FFFE>
I will follow your orders from now on.<$FFFC>
Please give me instructions.<$FFFD>
And one more thing, please just call me Sophia.<$FFFE>

For Shika tribe!<$FFFC>
Poweer!!!<$FFFE>
Shikaaaa!<$FFFE>
Not fight you anymore.<$FFFC>
Do Kahni respect chief's order.<$FFFE>
What do you reply?<$FFFE>
Let's fight together!<$FFFE>
Have your wounds healed?<$FFFE>
I hope we won't regret it<$FFFE>
That's good.<$FFFC>
Let's fight together!<$FFFE>
Dho Khani is Champion.<$FFFD>
Never will lose again!<$FFFC>
This time show perseverance!<$FFFE>
Have your wounds from before healed already?<$FFFE>
Little scratch long gone.<$FFFD>
Just come home to bring wondrous stone.<$FFFE>
A wondrous stone you say?<$FFFE>
Pass through time.<$FFFC>
Time and Space is warped.<$FFFD>
Chief told me to get stone, ask chief.<$FFFE>
I hope we won't come to regret it.<$FFFE>
Do Kahni is Champion.<$FFFC>
Worry not, be cool!<$FFFE>
You friend now.<$FFFE>
Do you want to inquire about the stone Do Kahni mentioned?<$FFFE>
It isn't such an urgent matter;<$FFFD>
...but I'm curious about a wondrous stone Do Kahni mentioned.<$FFFE>
That stone cross through time.<$FFFC>
Past, present, future, all become one with it.<$FFFE>
What do you reply?<$FFFE>
I see<$FFFE>
May I have it<$FFFE>
I doubt that<$FFFE>
I see.<$FFFC>
That certainly sounds miraculous...<$FFFE>
That's one wondrous stone alright.<$FFFC>
Would you mind hand it over to me?<$FFFE>
Not possible, request must be refused.<$FFFC>
Searched very long time, it's treasure.<$FFFC>
Very important.<$FFFE>
There couldn't be an object with such powers.<$FFFC>
It's just some stupid superstitious belief.<$FFFE>
Shika god made you the fool!<$FFFC>
Shika god is real.<$FFFC>
Stone has powers.<$FFFE>
It's nothing.<$FFFC>
It wasn't that urgent after all.<$FFFE>
Is something the matter, Sir [diehardt's name]?<$FFFE>
Your reply?<$FFFE>
There's that stone<$FFFE>
I came to protect you<$FFFE>
It's nothing<$FFFE>
To tell the truth there's something I wanted to ask of you.<$FFFE>
Hm, what could that be?<$FFFE>
The chieftain has a wondrous stone, which I would like to get a closer look at, maybe you could ask him about it?<$FFFE>
I assume the stone is needed for something important then?<$FFFD>
...Alright.$FFFC>
I will ask the chief right away.<$FFFE>
I just wanted to see if you are well, Sophia.<$FFFE>
Thank you very much for your concern, Sir [diehardt's name].<$FFFE>
Oh, it's nothing.<$FFFE>
I see.<$FFFE>
Oh..., goddess.<$FFFE>
Umm, great chieftain.<$FFFC>
To speak frankly, I've got a request...<$FFFE>
Goddess can ask anything.<$FFFE>
Not long ago you came into possession of a special stone, I wondered if I by any chance could have it?<$FFFE>
Yes.<$FFFC>
Goddess means this stoneGoddess means this stone, I give after battle..<$FFFE>
Thank you very much great chief.<$FFFE>
Me not great before you.<$FFFC>
Serving goddess is joy.<$FFFC>
Shika family rejoices being of use.<$FFFE>
...You come across a large face on the ground.<$FFFE>
What do you wish to do?<$FFFE>
Pray before it<$FFFE>
Scribble on it<$FFFE>
Trample on it<$FFFE>
When you start to pray, the face smiles gently and begins to float.<$FFFD>
The mouth opens widely and an armor drops out...<$FFFE>
Aeneas Armor was obtained!<$FFFE>
When you scribble something on the face, the same starts floating while a wide grin comes across its mouth as it speaks :<$FFFD>
"Oh, what a fine taste you have.<$FFFC>
I'll reward you with something that should be much to your liking!"<$FFFE>
The fabulous Magical Bikini was obtained!<$FFFE>
As you trample on the face it grins at you eerily and<$FFFD>
returns to be an expressionless mask the moment after...<$FFFE>
Hehehe...<$FFFC>
Since that pest is dead our victory is as good as ours.<$FFFE>
How..foolish..<$FFFC>
Dying in such a place...<$FFFE>
You have to rescue....Sophia...<$FFFE>
OUCH!<$FFFC>
It hurts..IT HUURTS...<$FFFE>
Curses!<$FFFE>
My sword arm is growing heavy...<$FFFE>
Guaaa!<$FFFE>
Oh?<$FFFC>
Pure blackness is enshrouding my eyes...<$FFFE>
Please forgive my failings...<$FFFE>
That cannot be...<$FFFE>
Everyone please lend me some of your power...<$FFFE>
Uuu....<$FFFC>
Keh Shikairo be useless...<$FFFD>
Farewell...goddess<$FFFE>
Shika!<$FFFE>
Now, release Sophia!<$FFFE>
How could you make her endure something like this!<$FFFE>
U,uhh....<$FFFD>
Alright.<$FFFC>
Keh Shikairo admits defeat.<$FFFC>
Let the Sacrifice go.<$FFFE>
How very troublesome.<$FFFE>
Who's there!?<$FFFE>
Ah what a shame she would have made such a fine sacrifice.<$FFFD>
Without her Lushiris gate would've been done for good.<$FFFE>
A demon from Velzeria!?<$FFFE>
A demon from Velzeria!?<$FFFE>
Come forth my servants!<$FFFE>
Shika!<$FFFE>
Did we not kill this one before?!<$FFFC>
So you are toying with the dead too demon?!<$FFFE>
Did we not kill this one before?!<$FFFC>
So you are toying with the dead too, demon?!<$FFFE>
<$F702><$F702>Kha Shind how did this!? <$FFFC>
Why you direct spear at me?<$FFFE>
Ha!<$FFFE>
Don't bother.<$FFFD>
This one is my loyal servant now.<$FFFC>
Well, let the dance of death begin.<$FFFD>
Once the chief is no more, my little protege will take his place.<$FFFE>
Kill her!<$FFFC>
Kill Keh Shikairo<$FFFC>
Kha Shind becomes chief!<$FFFE>
Here they come!<$FFFE>
Keh Shikairo fights too!<$FFFC>
I won't let Kha Shind win!<$FFFE>
Please wait.<$FFFD>
With such wounds you cannot fight.<$FFFC>
In one moment you'll feel better.<$FFFE>
Big Wonder!<$FFFE>
Y-you're, goddess.....<$FFFE>
Oh my...<$FFFC>
It seems they think restorative magic to be a miracle.<$FFFE>
Sophia...<$FFFE>
What do you say?<$FFFE>
Safety must come first.<$FFFE>
Pity for the enemy is futile.<$FFFE>
You're very kind, aren't you.<$FFFE>
Safety must come first.<$FFFE>
Thank you so much for your help.<$FFFE>
Pity for the enemy is futile...<$FFFE>
...That may be true for you.<$FFFC>
However, I'm a shrine maiden and I won't abandon the suffering no matter who they are.<$FFFE>
You're very kind, aren't you Sophia?<$FFFE>
That...<$FFFC>
That's only natural for a shrine maiden.<$FFFE>
By the way, Sophia.<$FFFD>
It seems like that the demons could come here because the Lushiris Gate is non-functional at the moment.<$FFFD>
That's why we need to reinstate the southern gate.<$FFFE>
I see.<$FFFC>
First of all the Velzerian demons around here must perish. <$FFFE>
We must help goddess.<$FFFC>
Do battle with all of strength!<$FFFE>
Shika!<$FFFE>
Protect goddess.<$FFFC>
Keh Shikairo and Shika Tribe will fight for you!<$FFFE>
-Defeat Kah Shind<$FFFC>
 or Wormmaster Rag<$FFFE>
-Death of [diehardt's name]<$FFFE>
You will not take sacrifice!<$FFFC>
Shika, angry!<$FFFE>
You, wake up!<$FFFC>
Listen to order of Keh Shikairo!<$FFFE>
It's useless, no matter how many times you try.<$FFFC>
They are deaf to your prattling.<$FFFE>
Comrades return to old self!<$FFFE>
A bit slow, aren't you?<$FFFC>
There's absolutely no way to restore them!<$FFFE>
Attacking the comrade?<$FFFC>
Keh Shikairo won't do!<$FFFC>
Instead I kill you!<$FFFE>
Shurghikaa!<$FFFE>
What inferior material to work with, it can't be helped, this battle is over...<$FFFC>
It's really such a shame!<$FFFE>
But don't be sad, we'll meet again undoubtedly!<$FFFE>
Shikaaa!<$FFFE>
Kah Shind never becomes chief!<$FFFC>
Kah Shind will be!<$FFFE>
Kah Shind to weak to be chief!<$FFFE>
Wh..What?!<$FFFC>
I couldn't be defeated like this...<$FFFC>
This is unacceptable!<$FFFE>
Shiurgha!<$FFFE>
I've got to admit you just rose in my estimation, even though just a little.<$FFFC>
To show my affection, next time I'll tear you limb from limb personally!<$FFFE>
You have no business around here.<$FFFC>
Perish, you're an eyesore!<$FFFE>
For the sake of Velzeria we have to keep them from opening Lushiris Gate!<$FFFE>
That won't happen!<$FFFC>
Come, the world of darkness is awaiting you!<$FFFE>
Shiika!<$FFFE>
Shishika!<$FFFE>
Shikaka!<$FFFE>
Shika....<$FFFE>
Shi....<$FFFE>
Shika..<$FFFE>
Shikashiaktsuu!<$FFFE>
Shika!<$FFFE>
Shikaaaa!<$FFFE>
...Shi..ka...<$FFFE>
Shikuuuarghgh!<$FFFE>
Shikashikatsuu!<$FFFE>
ＧＹＡＡＡ‥‥<$FFFE>
Shika...<$FFFE>
Shi...<$FFFE>
PUSYU!<$FFFE>
PUSYU!<$FFFE>
Guaa!<$FFFE>
Shikaaaa!<$FFFE>
Sh-shika!<$FFFE>
You not belong here.<$FFFC>
You no longer part of Shika family!<$FFFE>
You have evil heart.<$FFFC>
And evil I cleanse!<$FFFE>
How?<$FFFC>
They being stronger than usual.<$FFFE>
Heheheh...<$FFFC>
But of course.<$FFFC>
You too could become strong beyond measure.<$FFFE>
Do Kahni is Champion.<$FFFC>
No need to be stronger.<$FFFE>
Hold it!<$FFFE>
...It seems like he escaped.<$FFFE>
Is it finally over?<$FFFC>
Thank goodness, I've got enough of this smelly place.<$FFFE>
You commanded us most skilfully, Sir [diehardt's name].<$FFFE>
Sir [diehardt's name]...<$FFFC>
We took much too long for completing this mission...<$FFFD>
I hate you...you know that?<$FFFE>
<$F705>Here is promised stone.<$FFFE>
Time and Space Warping Stone was obtained!<$FFFE>
Thank you, great chief.<$FFFE>
Sir [diehardt's name].<$FFFC>
Here's the stone you wanted.<$FFFE>
Thanks, Sophia.<$FFFC>
I'll make good use of it.<$FFFD>
It seems our battle with the Shika tribe is over.<$FFFC>
Now let us hurry to reinstate the southern gate!<$FFFE>
Yes.<$FFFE>
<$F705>Thank you, great chief.<$FFFE>
Good, it seems our battle with the Shika tribe is over.<$FFFD>
Let's go, Sophia.<$FFFC>
The southern gate awaits.<$FFFE>
<$F706><$F706>The Velzerian's got here already, we must make haste to reinstate Lushiris gate.<$FFFD>
Let us be on our way back to the shrine.<$FFFD>
Great chief of the Shika tribe, I must return to my duties now.<$FFFD>
If you are worried about your holy site, come and watch over our doings there.<$FFFC>
Godsend person grows strong.<$FFFE>
No, he isn't dead.<$FFFC>
His aura still emits life....<$FFFD>
This demon must be manipulating his mind.<$FFFE>
You are now goddess to us.<$FFFC>
We make holy oath not to hinder you,<$FFFC>
or do battle with any of you.<$FFFE>
